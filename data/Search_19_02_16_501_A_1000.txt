Meijers (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986), N. Gourbault, E Lescher-Moutoue & R. Rouch (1976, 1977, 1978) and P. van den Hurk & R. Leys (1985). Description of new species of the 'beticus-meridianus' group: P. malagensis n. sp. (Malaga), P. granadensis n. sp. (Granada), P. meijersae n. sp. (Albacete), P. soriensis (Soria), P. oviedensis (Oviedo), and of the 'ortizi' group: P. grafi (Santander), P. stocki (Santander), P. alavensis (Alava), P. navarrensis (Navarra), P. vizcayensis (Vizcaya), and P. guipuzcoensis (Guipuzcoa). The first group is mainly present in the Sierra Nevada environment and the Betic region (where remains of its stygophilic root P. beticus still exist), the second in the Vasco-Cantabrian region (where remain some relict populations of its root forms: P. ortizi, P. aragonensis, and P. ebrensis). Iberian species are generally endemic, either from the alluvial aquifer of a river (generally small or minute species), or from the aquifer of a karstic system (generally large epibenthic species). In contrast to all other taxa, P. lescherae is widely scattered in phreatic aquifers of the Ebro basin and adjacent rivers and typical of this large hydrographic system. All species, especially those of the 'ortizi' group, are strongly related to those of North Africa and the Aquitanian Basin. These countries together constitute a single biogeographic area. The Iberian Aselloidea fauna is the most interesting and diversified of the Ancient World. It includes a rich background of Stenasellidae species (ancient autochthonous thalassoid stocks, characteristic of the Meseta and Catalonia plates), then occurred the settlement by Atlantic' Asellidae lineages (Synasellus, Bragasellus), then the settlement by old surface Proasellus species (of Mediterranean origin), that gave birth to bushes of stygobitic taxa and finally the settlement of the recent perimediterranean Proasellus coxalis. But this fauna is still waiting for the settlement by the recent eastern invader Asellus aquaticus, which is currently invading the French Aquitanian Basin.									2	0		2	0	2			0067-4745			BIOSIS:PREV200400090771	J	"Adams, RP; Pandey, RN"								Analysis of Juniperus communis and its varieties based on DNA fingerprinting								BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY				31	11			1271	1278		10.1016/S0305-1978(03)00036-X			Nov-03	2003	"Plants of Juniperus communis L. var. communis, J. c. var. depressa Pursh, J. c. var. hemispherica J. & C.

Iberian endemisms (Guadalgenus franzi, Isoperla cf. nevada, Siphonoperla baetica, Rhabdiopteryx christinae, Protonemura alcazaba and Leuctra iliberis) are frequent in the area, and among them Besdolus bicolor is particularly interesting because of its scarcity. Tyrrhenoleuctra cf. minuta is here recorded from Granada province for the first time.

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found significant selection on flower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the flowers. When ungulates were present, selection on floral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on flower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and floral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conflicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination. An accurate picture of the pollinator role as selective pressure requires the consideration of the entire life cycle of the plant as well as the ecological scenario in which the interactions occur."									112	4	0	111	0	115			0003-0147			WOS:000184446500009	12858267J	"Galindo-Zaldivar, J; Gil, AJ; Borque, MJ; Gonzalez-Lodeiro, F; Jabaloy, A; Marin-Lechado, C; Ruano, P; de Galdeano, CS"				"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/K-3640-2012; JABALOY SANCHEZ, ANTONIO/L-2955-2014; Gil, Antonio/L-8173-2014; Ruano, Patricia/L-9168-2014; Gonzalez Lodeiro, Francisco/H-8824-2015"	"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/0000-0002-3493-2637; JABALOY SANCHEZ, ANTONIO/0000-0001-5830-5913; Gil, Antonio/0000-0003-0351-4106; Ruano, Patricia/0000-0003-3833-4973; Gonzalez Lodeiro, Francisco/0000-0003-3810-7965"			Active faulting in the internal zones of the central Betic Cordilleras (SE, Spain)								JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS				36	01-Feb			239	250		10.1016/S0264-3707(03)00049-8			AUG-SEP 2003	2003	The internal zones of the Betic Cordilleras show a present-day relief that is mainly controlled by kilometre-size, symmetrical or north-vergent folds which developed mostly since Middle Miocene times. The Sierra Nevada, Sierra Alhamilla, Sierra de Los Filabres, Sierra Tejeda and Sierra de Gador, among others, are roughly E-W trending high mountain ranges, corresponding to antiforms where metamorphic rocks crop out. The surrounding depressions are located in synforms, where Neogene rocks are preserved from erosion. Field evidence shows that the growth of the folds is coeval with fault development, and that at least three of them, i.e. the Padul Fault, the Zafarraya Fault, and the Balanegra Fault, may be considered to be active seismogenetic structures. The Zafarraya Fault, in particular, is thought to be responsible for the 1884 Andalucia Earthquake. The fault is located at the northern limb of the Sierra Tejeda antiform, and could be interpreted as a collapse structure developed along the external arch of the uplifted fold. The Padul and Balanegra faults are located at the southeastern border of the Granada Basin and south of the Sierra de Gador, respectively. They belong to a set of NW-SE oriented faults that are mainly normal in character and indicate NE-SW extension. The set up, since 1999, of a GPS network within and around the Granada Basin and the planed installation of a new network in the Sierra Tejeda, will give us new insights on the present-day deformation behaviour of both folds and faults in the area.

We monitored the natural establishment of the oak for 3 years in two forest plots and two shrubland plots, by counting seedlings and juveniles. In addition, we established several experiments in these plots to examine acorn and seedling survival, while also considering the microhabitat effect on survival probability. Dispersed acorns were quickly consumed by several species of predators, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa) and woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Less than 4% of the experimental acorns survived to produce seedlings, even when they were buried 4 cm in soil, simulating caches. No effect of microhabitat was found on predation, and thus no safe site appears to exist for Q. pyrenaica acorns in the study area. Some 98% of the 1000 experimental seedlings were killed by herbivores, notably woodmice, wild boar, and domestic and wild ungulates. Seedling Survival varied spatially, being significantly higher under shrubs (4%) than in any other microhabitat (less than 0.5%)..Both acorn and seedling survival were much lower in the shrublands than in the forests. In shrubland plots, the main agent of seedling mortality was trampling by domestic ungulates foraging in herds. This study suggests that the regeneration of Q. pyrenaica forests in Mediterranean mountains can be limited by herbivores acting at several life-history stages. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Tourmaline appears in a variety of forms: (1) stratiform tourmalinites; (2) quartz-tourmaline nodules; (3) porphyroclasts in felsic orthogneisses; and (4) disseminations in psammopelitic meta-sediments and gneisses. Tourmaline within these lithologic groups exhibits textural and chemical variations that reflect complex premetamorphic growth under open-system conditions, and subsequent changes due to Alpine regional metamorphism. Microprobe analyses of the tourmalines reveal a wide compositional variation between schorl and dravite end members with variable contents of X-site vacancies (av. 0.084-0.225 apfu), Ca (av. 0.095-0.269 apfu), and excess of Al (up to 6.588 apfu) compared with the theoretical value of 6 in ideal schorl and dravite. The amount of Ca may be significant in porphyroclasts from the gneisses. Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios for tourmalines in tourmalinites, metasediments, and gneisses range from 0.34 to 0.95, 0.16 to 0.92, and 0.28 to 0.97, respectively. Na/(Na + Ca) ratios are also variable, mostly ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. Many of the tourmalines have complex chemical and colour zoning patterns, including significant fluctuations in Al, Fe, Mg, Na, Ca, Ti, and F. Based on petrographic and chemical data, three generations of tourmaline have been established. The first generation corresponds to magmatic-postmagmatic tourmaline that is represented by tourmaline porphyroclasts within the orthogneisses. The second generation of tourmaline formed during tourmalinization of psammopelitic rocks giving rise to tourmalinites. The third generation of tourmaline is represented by cellular textures, pale reaction rims and overgrowths developed during the Alpine regional metamorphic overprint. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Electron microprobe analyses of tourmaline and coexisting minerals document both chemical differences dependent on the host-rock type and an irregular distribution of Cr at grain scale. Tourmaline is Na-rich dravite, with average Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios of 0.83 and 0.63 a.p.f.u. and Cr contents of 0.32 and 0.18 a.p.f.u., in dolomitic and ankeritic marbles, respectively. Tourmaline contains small but significant concentrations of Zn (av. 0.01 a.p.f.u.) and in ankeritic marble it also contains Ni (av. 0.04 a.p.f.u.). Zn-rich chromian spinet appears as small relict inclusions in silicates, with average Cr, Fe, Al and Zn contents of 1.201, 1.241, 0.411 and 0.107 a.p.f.u., respectively. Amphibole, epidote, mica and chlorite show average Cr contents of 0.088, 0.138, 0.115 and 0.267 a.p.f.u., respectively, in dolomitic marbles, and 0.103, 0.078, 0.065 and 0.185 a.p.f.u., respectively, in ankeritic marbles. Cr-silicates formed through metamorphic reactions involving detrital Cr-rich spinet, in addition to clay minerals and carbonates.

The overall diet differed essentially from that of the Mediterranean region, which surrounds the study area, since in these areas rabbits constitute the primary prey. However, the diet of the mountain wildcats is similar to that in the Eurosiberian floral region, despite its distance from the Sierra Nevada.

Our results showed a very restricted breeding season, despite the fact that the Spanish ibex originates from and lives in a temperate latitude, revealing a remarkably good adaptation to the harsh climatic and nutritional conditions of their mountainous habitat.									18	0	0	19	1	19			0926-5287			WOS:000186077200001	14620629J	"Ruiz, AM; Ferhat, G; Alfaro, P; de Galdeano, CS; de Lacy, MC; Rodriguez-Caderot, G; Gil, AJ"				"Gil, Antonio/L-8173-2014; ALFARO GARCIA, PEDRO/H-2038-2015"	"Gil, Antonio/0000-0003-0351-4106; ALFARO GARCIA, PEDRO/0000-0002-2753-2969"			Geodetic measurements of crustal deformation on NW-SE faults of the Betic Cordillera, southern Spain, 1999-2001								JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS				35	3			259	272	PII S0264-3707(02)00134-5	10.1016/S0264-3707(02)00134-5			Apr-03	2003	The Granada basin, located in the central sector of the Betic Cordillera, is one of the most seismically active zones of the Iberian Peninsula. For the first time, a geodetic network along the Padul fault and two levelling profiles (Genil and Viznar) crossing the Granada fault were operated to detect crust micro-deformations in this area. Three years of terrestrial geodetic measurements are analysed to characterize the behaviour of these faults in a low to moderate strain rate environment. After the comparison of these three campaigns, we can conclude that there is no significant short-term movement of the Padul fault. Granada fault measurements show significant differences between 1999 and 2001 campaigns in Viznar profile. However, more data are needed to correlate this displacement to the tectonic activity.

Teladorsagia circumcincta and Marshallagia marshalli were the most abundant abomasal species, whereas N. abnormalis, N. davtiani, and N. oiratianus were dominant in the small intestine. Counts of both abomasal and intestinal nematodes were generally low (year-round-median = 292 and 94 worms, respectively), and significantly lower numbers of M. marshalli, N. davtiani, and N. oiratianus were found in summer. No sex-related differences in helminth abundance were found, but young ibex harbored significantly more N. davtiani and N. oiratianus than adults.

These populations are isolated in high mountains, which tends to protect them from the attack of a severe defoliating Mediterranean pest, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. However, as a consequence of climate change, the pine processionary caterpillar has increasingly attacked populations of this pine in recent years. This work describes the detrimental effects of defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar in P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis in Sierra Nevada. Defoliation strongly reduced pine growth as well as all the reproductive parameters measured (female and male cone production, mature cone size, seed production and seed weight), in addition to some deaths. If winter temperatures continue to increase; the pine processionary caterpillar will have a dangerous impact in these relict pine populations, by further reducing the pine's weak regeneration capacity. We suggest some mitigation actions based on managing habitat structure, in order to reduce or avoid such negative impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The miginatites and schists suffered a coaxial-flattening event during isothermal decompression and were later exhumed by ductile ESE non-coaxial stretching. Further exhumation was achieved by W- to SW-transport brittle low-angle normal faulting, Subsequently these extensional structures were gently folded in the core of a NE/SW-oriented antiform during the Tortonian. Finally the Santi Petri domal geometry was accentuated by the interference of orthogonal high-angle faults with ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE orientation. This core-complex-like structure, formed by superposition of extensional and compressive tectonic events, does not represent a classical, purely extensional core complex, which shows that metamorphic structure and geometry are not decisive criteria to define a core-complex.

Uplift amounts and average rates can be estimated using the current elevation of the outcrops of well-dated deposits indicative of ancient sea-level positions. Coral reefs and coastal conglomerates record the initial development of emergent Belie relief during the Langhian. Continental and marginal marine deposits indicate the existence of a large island centred on the present Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain by the end of the Middle Miocene. The precursor of the Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain, originally part of this large island, remained emerged whilst the surrounding areas were re-invaded by the sea during the early Tortonian. At the end of the Tortonian the inland basins (Granada and Guadix. basins) became continental, while the Sierras de la Contraviesa, Sierra de Gador and Sierra Alhamilla emerged, separating the Alboran Basin from the Alpujarra, Tabernas and Sorbas basins, which became narrow passages of the Mediterranean Sea. In contrast, the Sierra Cabrera emerged during the late Messinian, suggesting a progressive uplift from west to east of the sierras south of the Sierra Nevada- Sierra de los Filabres chain. During the Pliocene, only the low areas closest to the present-day coast remained as marine basins and progressively emerged throughout this stage. The highest average uplift rate recorded is 280 m/Ma for the Sierra de Gador, although the average uplift rates of upper-Neogene coastal marine rocks since depositon have maximum values of approximately 200 m/Ma. Most of the uplift of the Betic mountains took place before the early Pliocene. The recorded uplift of Neogene rocks was highest at the margins of western Sierra Nevada, where peaks higher than 3000 in occur. The average rates of uplift were lower to the east of this major relief. The main sierras and depressions in the present-day landscape correspond respectively to the emergent land, in which uplift was concentrated, and to the marine basins that existed before the final emergence of the region. The altitude of the sierras reflects the time at which they became emergent, the highest mountains being the first to rise above sea level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mountain ranges in the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordillera are exhumed massifs of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, and are surrounded by low-lying sedimentary basins. The Neogene history of mountain range uplift and basin formation in the Belies is well studied, but Quaternary topographic development and its relation to convergent plate boundary tectonics is less understood. Deformation, rates of stream incision and factors controlling landscape evolution on the flanks of the highest mountains in the Betic Cordillera are studied to gain insight on the relationship of Quaternary tectonics to topographic development. Specifically, geomorphic processes that led to formation of topographic relief within the Internal Zone of the Belie Cordillera are assessed.This paper is based on a field study conducted in the eastern Alpujarran Corridor (EAC), which is the eastern half of a 4-6 km wide and 80-km long inverted sedimentary basin. The Mid to Late Quaternary history of basin denudation is deduced on the basis of morphostratigraphic, geochronologic and structural-geologic analyses of oxygen isotope Stage 8-time fluvial deposits in the EAC.Results of these analyses indicate that climate and faulting played only a minor role in landscape evolution in the EAC. Instead, the EAC topographic trough was excavated by a drainage network whose axial stream (Rio Andarax) was incising at a rate between 0.3 and 0.7 m/ka since oxygen isotope Stage 8. This paper demonstrates that these incision rates are the same as regional rock uplift rates in the EAC. During the Mid and Late Quaternary, topographic relief between the EAC and adjacent mountain ranges developed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift.The implications of the results of this investigation are used to propose a model of Quaternary topographic relief development in the Internal Zone of Betic Cordillera. Topographic relief between Internal Zone bedrock massifs and adjacent basins formed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift. Faulting also played a significant role in areas that are within a few kilometers of crustal-scale fault zones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Depending (amongst others) on the relative importance of these two factors, the margins of terrestrial sedimentary basins (where alluvial fans develop) produce aggradational, progradational or retrogradational stratigraphic architecture.We studied a total of 43 Quaternary alluvial fans in the Granada and Bajo Segura basins (Betic Cordillera, Spain). The analysis of their stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary facies has revealed the existence of three groups characterised by distinct stratal stacking patterns, which is the result of differences in eustasy and tectonics. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these alluvial fans and their drainage basins has allowed us to define certain characteristic geomorpbological patterns related, in each case, to the main mechanism operative in the creation of accommodation space. These patterns are described as follows.(1) Alluvial aggradation is the main result of high tectonic subsidence with the development of quite open, but small fans with a constant steep slope lacking incised channels and headward-eroding gullies.(2) In contrast, when the principal mechanism in creating accommodation space is low tectonic subsidence, progradation occurs and the fans are narrower and larger. Moreover, the slopes of such fans are less steep in relation to the drainage area than in the above case, being constant or even concave in longitudinal profile. They also have short, deep incised channels, culminating downfan in a depositional lobe. In inactive zones, long, deep headward-eroding gullies develop.(3) Areas of extremely low tectonic subsidence and base level rise produce very open fans in the sedimentary basin, although with a pronounced mountain embayment, which gives them a characteristic ""mushroom"" shape in plan view. In the latter case, retrogradation is the typical stratigraphic stacking pattern and the fans are quite extensive with respect to their drainage areas, usually showing a segmented longitudinal profile with a low gradient. The feeder channels do not surpass stream order 3, and various extremely long and shallow incised channels can appear.(4) Contrary to the case of fans developing under a regime of subsidence, when the accommodation is due to base level rise, the fan slopes bear no relation to the extent of the catchment basins. In such a case, the overall fan slope is strongly influenced by the extent of the mountain embayment because it determines the distributions of debris and sheet-flows over the alluvial surface.

The review of the literature on which we base this work extends from 1813, the date when the first article on Sierra Nevada fauna appeared, to 2000. In the zoological history of the Sierra Nevada, we distinguish two important events, the monographs of Rambur and Rosenhauer in the 19th century, and the entomological expeditions made almost simultaneously by Mateu and Janetscheck towards the middle of the 20th century. After 1970, with the founding of the Biology studies at the University of Granada, the number of articles concerning this massif notably increased. During the period studied here, 427 articles were published, 80% of which were dedicated to insects. In these articles, 356 new species were described for science, these also mainly insects. We therefore highlight that the interest regarding biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada cannot be focused exclusively on plant species or on vertebrates, groups which are emblematic for protection measures, but that the arthropods should be taken heavily into account for establishing protective measures for the environment.									0	0		1	0	1			0210-8984			ZOOREC:ZOOR14707054225	J	Martinez Rica, J.P.

The glacier gradually retreated during the last century, leaving a large talus slope at the base of the wall. The unconsolidated material covering the ice masses acted as a thermal insulator. Recent bottom temperature of snow (BTS) analyses and drillings indicate that the ice still exists within the talus. Evidence from field observations made during the period 1995-2001. revealed that large mass movements occurred during the driest summers ( 1998 and especially. 1999 and 2000) when the talus was snow free. These conditions suggest a direct relationship between talus stability and thermal insulation from the snow cover in areas where buried ice or decaying marginal permafrost exists.									8	0	0	1	0	8			0435-3676			WOS:000184473900003	J	"Critelli, S; Arribas, J; Le Pera, E; Tortosa, A; Marsaglia, KM; Latter, KK"								The recycled orogenic sand provenance from an uplifted thrust belt, Betic Cordillera, southern Spain								JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH				73	1			72	81		10.1306/071002730072			Jan-03	2003	"The Betic Cordillera of southern Spain represents an uplifted foreland fold-thrust belt. Source rock types of the Betic Cordillera include metamorphic (mainly phyllite, schist, quartzite, and gneiss), sedimentary (siliciclastic and carbonate), volcanic (felsic to intermediate pyroclasts), and mantle-derived (peridotite, gabbro, serpentinite, and serpentine schist) rocks. The fluvial systems range that transect the Betic Cordillera are the major detrital source of sediment along the southern Spanish coast, supplying sand to beaches and offshore depositional systems in the Alboran Sea basin.Three key sand petrofacies derived from the Betic mountain belt reflect the main elastic contribution of known source rocks. All the sands are quartzolithic, ranging from quartz-rich to lithic-rich.Fluvial systems draining the Sierra de Los Filabres, the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra de Gador, and the Malaga Mountains, and their related beaches constitute a metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic sand petrofacies (Qm34 +/- 10 F4 +/- 3 U62 +/- 9; Lm72 +/- 14 Lv2 +/- 4 Ls26 +/- 13), derived dominantly from the Nevado-Filabride, Alpujarride, and Malaguide complexes. This quartzolithic petrofacies extends from northeast of Almeria to Torremolinos (southwest of Malaga), and northeast of Algeciras. Only one beach sand sample, east of Cabo de Gata, is volcanolithic. Volcanic detritus (mainly having felsitic textures) is derived from Miocene (15-7 Ma) pyroclastic sequences cropping out in the southeast of the chain.This metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic petrofacies changes in the coastal stretch from Torremolinos to Marbella, where drainage systems cut across the Serrania de Ronda. Here source rock types include peridotite, gabbro, and serpentinite of the Ronda Peridotite Massif, and metamorphic rocks of the Malaguide and Alpujarride units. The fluvial and beach sands of this area are quartzolithic (Qm32 +/- 12 F10 +/- 3 U58 +/- 11), and include abundant peridotite and serpentinite grains. The latter quartzolithic petrofacies changes abruptly from Algeciras to Cadiz, where the sand becomes quartz-rich (Qm77 +/- 5 F4 +/- 2 U19 +/- 4). This sand petrofacies is derived predominantly from recycling of sedimentary sequences, mainly the quartzarenite turbidite units of the Gibraltar Arc (the Algeciras Flysch). This petrofacies is characterized by higher proportion of quartz grains and abundant sedimentary lithic fragments (Lm1 +/- 3 Lv1 +/- 1 Ls98 +/- 3).The three onshore petrofacies plot in the recycled-orogen provenance compositional field and the lithic to transitional to quartzose recycled subfields of Dickinson (1985). They vary from lithic, to transitional and quartzose depending on their source lithologies in the Betic foreland fold-thrust belt. These actualistic petrofacies best describe the nature and distribution of sand petrofacies derived from a collisional fold-thrust belt where primary and recycled source rocks are interfingered.Deep-marine turbidites of the Alboran Basin have basinwide quartzolithic sands having close compositional relations with Betic Cordillera onshore sand petrofacies. Comparison of detrital modes from mainland to deep-marine environments provides a suitable basis for interpreting the Miocene to Pleistocene sand dispersal history in the Alboran Basin. These modern quartzolithic petrofacies are used to interpret analogous ancient collisional sandstone petrofacies of the Alpine orogenic belt of the western-central Mediterranean region and of other collisional orogenic systems, as a broader point of view."									25	0	0	2	0	25			1527-1404			WOS:000180490900008	J	"Perez, JM; Gonzalez, FJ; Granados, JE; Perez, MC; Fandos, P; Soriguer, RC; Serrano, E"				"CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Serrano, Emmanuel/J-4489-2013; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014; Fandos, Paulino/M-7304-2015"	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Serrano, Emmanuel/0000-0002-9799-9804; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766; Fandos, Paulino/0000-0002-9607-8931"			Hematologic and biochemical reference intervals for Spanish ibex								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				39	1			209	215					Jan-03	2003	We studied blood samples from 529 Spanish ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) from different Andalusian mountain ranges in southern Spain, primarily from Sierra Nevada.

Madrono				50	1			21	27					January-March 2003	2003	Regeneration of hardwood species on three streams in the northern Sierra Nevada was correlated with several environmental factors. The occurrence of seedlings of Salix lutea (yellow willow), Salix laevigata (red willow), and Alnus tenuifolia (mountain alder) were negatively correlated with canopy cover and litter depth, and positively correlated with solar radiation. All three species occurred more frequently on sandy soils where the stream channel was wide and the slope was relatively shallow. The occurrence of Populus fremontii (black cottonwood) seedlings was negatively correlated with canopy cover, and sandy soils, and positively correlated with distance from the watercourse and solar radiation. Acer macrophyllum (big leaf maple) and Cornus sericea (American dogwood) seedlings occurred under relatively dense canopy cover, in low light environments, but were limited to sandy soils and wide stream channels. Results indicate that the hardwood species that exist in riparian corridors within the Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest type are variably reliant on conditions common to flood prone areas such as sandy mineral soils and a high light environment for regeneration.									3	0		4	0	4			0024-9637			BIOSIS:PREV200300418635	J	Desjardin, DL								A unique ballistosporic hypogeous sequestrate Lactarius from California								MYCOLOGIA				95	1			148	155		10.2307/3761974			JAN-FEB 2003	2003	Lactarius rubriviridis sp. nov., characterized by hypogeous, sequestrate basidiomes with red latex, green stains, and forcibly discharged, reticulate basidiospores is described and illustrated.

Differences in the preferences of birds according to the orientation of the nest-boxes were not found. Birds showed a tendency to prefer those nest-boxes placed in more open and sunned sites than those placed in more closed and darkened sites. These results suggest that the use of different types of next-boxes would increase the number of protected species using them."									1	0		1	0	1			1130-4251			ZOOREC:ZOOR14212075470	S	Martinez Rica, J.

The degree of use was 15% for herbaceous vegetation and 10.3% for woody vegetation, The most used species were those with moderate amounts in diet composition of both ruminants. The main plant groups consumed by Spanish ibex were graminoids (57.5%), shrubs (20.5%) and chamaephytes (14.3%). Sheep consumed graminoids (41.6%), forbs (32.3%) and chamaephytes (20.9%). There was a significant correlation between the two diets, with an overlap of 56.3%. The highest indices of selection were found in items with moderate-low availability and which comprised moderate levels in the diet composition of the two species. Spanish ibex mainly selected diet according to availability, while sheep selection depended on protein content, The ibex consumed cell wall-rich resources such as grasses and shrubs, while the sheep consumed higher quality feed and includes more forbs in its diet.									7	2	0	9	0	10			Jan-51			WOS:000180049800010	J	"Soler, M; Martin-Vivaldi, M; Perez-Contreras, T"				Perez-Contreras, Tomas/M-8065-2014	Perez-Contreras, Tomas/0000-0002-2271-1706			Identification of the sex responsible for recognition and the method of ejection of parasitic eggs in some potential common cuckoo hosts								ETHOLOGY				108	12			1093	1101		10.1046/j.1439-0310.2002.00841.x			Dec-02	2002	Egg rejection is the most common defence used by hosts against avian brood parasites and experimental studies have provided some of the best documented demonstrations of the coevolutionary process. However, the sex responsible for egg ejection and whether eggs are grasped or punctured are two essential questions that remain unanswered for most host species. In this paper, by filming the behaviour of individuals of three different species confronted with a foreign egg experimentally introduced into their nests, we first determine the relationship between recognition (when the birds aggressively pecked the experimental egg) and ejection. Secondly, we demonstrate that in the species where only the female incubates, only the female recognizes and ejects the model egg, whereas in the two species where both sexes incubate, both sexes eject the foreign egg. Finally, the large host species ejected the model egg by grasping it with the bill, whereas the two small species ejected it by puncturing it first. Furthermore, our data suggest that puncture ejection is more costly than grasping ejection considered both in terms of energetic and ejection costs.									28	0	0	27	0	28			0179-1613			WOS:000179799800005	J	"Mota, JF; Perez-Garcia, FJ; Jimenez, ML; Amate, JJ; Penas, J"				"Perez-Gacia, Francisco/N-7557-2014; Penas, Julio/N-4885-2014; Mota, Juan/M-2254-2014"	"Perez-Gacia, Francisco/0000-0002-5778-2803; Penas, Julio/0000-0001-6102-4610; Mota, Juan/0000-0001-5754-279X"			Phytogeographical relationships among high mountain areas in the Baetic Ranges (South Spain)								GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY				11	6			497	504		10.1046/j.1466-822X.2002.00312.x			Nov-02	2002	The Mediterranean area is regarded nowadays as one of the hot-spots of world biodiversity. The Baetic ranges in Spain have such a large number of endemic plant taxa that the territory has been recognized as a well-defined biogeographical unit. These endemic taxa tend to concentrate on disjunct highland areas that have been described consequently as 'highland islands'. Despite the importance and complexity of these sites, the research carried out so far has produced only descriptive classifications. These approaches overlook the relationships between the sites and do not serve to identify the main centres of endemism. Herein, multivariate analysis techniques (cluster analysis and reciprocal averaging) and the parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), applied to the 222 orophilous endemic taxa of the Baetic ranges, have been used to reveal the floristic similarities between the areas involved, to identify the centres of endemism and to re-assess the previous classifications. Four centres of endemism are defined, one siliceous and three calcareous. The most outstanding feature in the Baetic ranges is precisely the floristic difference between siliceous and calcareous mountains. Calcareous territories extend along a SW-NE axis in line with the oceanic-continental gradient. The nature of the soil in the vast siliceous and calcareous-dolomitic territories of the Sierra Nevada is probably the cause of the remarkable floristic diversity. Not surprisingly, in our analysis these areas stand out as centres of endemism. We conclude that previous biogeographical classifications of the ranges are too rigid and do not properly reflect the floristic similarities of the area under study.									41	1	0	38	1	44			0960-7447			WOS:000179978200007	J	"Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sanchez, JM; Carrillo, P"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"				Microbial plankton response to contrasting climatic conditions: insights from community structure, productivity and fraction stoichiometry								AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				29	3			253	266		10.3354/ame029253			OCT 23 2002	2002	Climatic events are among the most important forces governing natural processes in ecosystems. Over a 3 yr period, we monitored changes in the hydrological, chemical and biological regimes of a high mountain lake severely affected by a drought that peaked in 1995. During the drought, the decrease in lake volume enhanced the contribution of the sediment to the lake nutrient budget. The community became more complex, with the appearance of ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, organisms rarely found prior to the drought. The impaired post-drought recovery of the zooplankton, which did not reach normal densities for this lake until 1997, resulted in a microbial-dominated food web in 1996 and a classical grazing food web in 1997. Besides the species composition or abundance and the autotrophic to heterotrophic ratio, food web changes associated with the drought and atmospheric nutrient inputs were reflected in the stoichiometry and contribution of both bacteria and phytoplankton fractions to the planktonic particulate matter. Specific productivity measurements showed that cellular N:P ratios could be used to evaluate the growth conditions of phytoplankton but not of bacteria, indicating that an element other than P may limit bacteria growth. Assessments of phytoplankton and bacteria productivity and of the photosynthetic carbon release relative to bacteria demand in microcosms revealed that after a phosphorus pulse, the phytoplankton N:P ratio determines the nature of the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria as either commensalistic or competitive for inorganic P. If phytoplankton N:P is initially high (P-deficient algae), a P pulse can reduce photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) and bacteria can experience C limitation, whereas if phytoplankton N:P is initially low (P-sufficient algae) and bacteria N:P is high, increased PER is observed and competition for inorganic P may occur.									18	0	0	16	0	18			0948-3055			WOS:000179257300004	J	"Angeler, DG; Garcia, G; Schagerl, M"								Heterotrophic euglenoid flagellates from the Sierra Nevada Natural Park area (Southern Spain)								CRYPTOGAMIE ALGOLOGIE				23	4			311	332					OCT-DEC 2002	2002	In this study we report on 22 species of colourless euglenoid flagellates that were found in the Sierra Nevada Natural Park region (southern Spain), many of them rarely and infrequently reported from nature.

In this study, we investigate the mechanisms blocking colonization by Pinus sylvestris of the meadows. Two experiments were conducted in which seeds were sown either at I cm depth or on the surface to simulate dispersal, and three treatments of vegetation removal were applied: Disturbed (where the herbaceous layer was eliminated, exposing the mineral soil), Clipped (vegetation cut at ground level) and Control (no disturbance of the herbaceous layer). In addition, the effect of seed predators was controlled by using wire cages in the case of the surface sown experiment.When seeds were sown at I cm depth, seedling emergence was not reduced by the herbaceous layer. In contrast, when seeds were surface sown and predators were excluded, the rate of emergence was low in the Control treatment, intermediate in Clipped and high in Disturbed. Seedling emergence was, however, minimal when predators were not excluded, irrespective of the disturbance level. Seedling survival and growth after three years of study were similar among treatments. The results show that the seed predation and the physical barrier created by the herbaceous layer are the two mechanisms blocking the encroachment of Pinus sylvestris onto these Mediterranean mountain meadows, limiting the regeneration and potential expansion of the forest.									39	1	0	33	0	43			1100-9233			WOS:000180300000013	J	"Gutierrez Larena, B.; Fuertes Aguilar, J.; Nieto Feliner, G."

The present day extension is accommodated by normal faults with various orientations but particularly with a NW-SE strike. At the surface, these active NW-SE normal faults are mainly concentrated on the NE part of the Basin. In this part we have selected a 15-km long segment where several active normal faults crop out. Using the marine Tortonian rocks as a reference, we have calculated a minimum extensional rate of 0.15-0.30 mm/year. The observed block rotation, the listric geometry of faults at depth and the distribution of seismicity over the whole Basin, indicate that this rate is a minimum value. In the framework of an interdisciplinary research project a non-permanent GPS-network has been established in the central sector of Betic Cordillera to monitor the crustal deformations. The first two observation campaigns were done in 1999 and 2000.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0039-3169			WOS:000177223000002	J	"Ramon Fernandez-Cardenete, Juan; Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel"				Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/K-8143-2014	Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-1616-9815			First records of Osmylus fulvicephalus (Scopoli. 1763) in southern Iberian Peninsula (Planipennia, Osmylidae).

The work reported here analysed host utilisation by the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), the relationship between moth oviposition patterns and larval performance, the chemical characteristics of the plant in relation to the performance of different larval instars, and the role of these factors in the outbreak capacity of the species. In order to do this, a combination of field and laboratory techniques was used to study three pine species differing in nutritional characteristics.2. Moths oviposited in the three pine species analysed, although cluster pine received a lower number of batches. Late-instar larvae were able to feed on all three pine species, however first-instar larvae developed on Scots and black pine but died on cluster pine. Consequently, oviposition in cluster pine can be considered an oviposition mistake, and indicates that moths are rather unselective when ovipositing on different pine species.3. Chemical analysis of needles suggested that the quantity of nitrogen was the main factor responsible for the difference in survival of larvae.4. The oviposition pattern of the moth and the larval susceptibility to food quality in Thaumetopoea pityocampa agree with the theory that unselective oviposition of the moth is a precondition for eruptive dynamics in phytophagous insects.5. The success of the larvae depends mainly on the probability of the moth finding a suitable host. This probability is determined strongly by the changes of structure and coverage in Mediterranean pine woodlands, due to human management.									46	5	0	45	0	51			0307-6946			WOS:000175841800005	J	"Donaire, T; Saez, R; Pascual, E"				Donaire, Teodosio/P-7032-2014	Donaire, Teodosio/0000-0001-5582-2253			Rhyolitic globular peperites from the Aznalcollar mining district (Iberian Pyrite Belt, Spain): physical and chemical controls								JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH				114	01-Feb	SI		119	128	PII S0377-0273(01)00287-6	10.1016/S0377-0273(01)00287-6			MAY 15 2002	2002	Globular peperites are exposed along the Aznalcollar mining district, Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), Spain. These rocks originated by mingling of a low-viscosity rhyolitic sill with unlithified, wet sediments. Highly amygdaloidal (up to 80% vol., millimeters to centimeters across) rhyolite globules extend from the upper contact of the sill for several centimeters into fine-grained volcaniclastic host rocks. The sill is very similar to other rhyolites in the IPB in terms of petrography and chemistry. It is aphyric to very sparsely quartz-phyric, with small quartz phenocrysts. Vesicularity has been measured in the sill as vesicle area fraction, determined by point counting over a rectangular grid, and number density per unit area, determined by counting every vesicle within the grid area. Amygdale distribution, measured within the sill, indicates a process by which vesicles migrated vertically from the lower portions of the sill to the roof zone. We suggest that this migration process caused local density changes, large enough to allow the rhyolitic magma to become buoyant enough to move through the overlying sediments, producing globular peperites. Globular structures are preserved when rhyolite globules entered the wet sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Folding accompanied tectonic denudation developing elongated domes with fold axes both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of extension. The geometry, kinematics, and tectonic evolution of two major sequentially developed extensional fault systems have been characterized in several E-W elongated mountain ranges of the central Betics on the basis of new cartographic and structural data and a comprehensive revision of other available geological and geophysical observations. The extensional systems have an average WSW direction of extension and led to exhumation of the two lower metamorphic complexes of the Betics, the Nevado-Filabride and the Alpujarride, during the middle and upper Miocene (Serravallian to Tortonian). The extended domain contains a core complex, with distal and proximal antiformal hinges separated by around 60 km and with a fold amplitude of similar to6 km (measured parallel to the direction of extension). The total amount of extension across the core complex is about 109-116 km, corresponding to a stretching factor (beta) of 3.5-3.9, estimated using the distance between fold axial surfaces and a geometrical model accomplishing footwall deformation during tectonic denudation via subvertical simple shear. The elongated domal and basinal geometry of the detachments and their respective footwalls is due to the interference between two sets of orthogonal large-scale open folds, trending N-S and E-W. Longitudinal, N-S trending folds are interpreted as isostatic folds, i.e., folds that developed in response to differential unloading of the extensional detachment footwalls inducing ductile flow in the middle crust. These folds formed in a rolling-hinge anticline in which rotation migrates westward through the footwall as it is progressively unroofed. In contrast, E-W trending folds, being subparallel to the direction of extension, have a contractional origin and progressively affect to the west the isostatically readjusted segments of the detachments once they are inactive. Orthogonal folding occurred since the Serravallian to lower Pliocene. Extension is still active from the rolling-hinge anticline in Sierra Nevada to the west. The middle Miocene to Pliocene tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome at the core of the Betic hinterland is another example of the coexistence of extension and contraction during continued overall convergence and mountain-building.									47	0	0	2	0	47			0278-7407			WOS:000178945100007	J	"Jerome, CA; Ford, BA"								The discovery of three genetic races of the dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium americanum (Viscaceae) provides insight into the evolution of parasitic angiosperms								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				11	3			387	405		10.1046/j.0962-1083.2002.01463.x			Mar-02	2002	"A population genetic approach was used to explore the evolutionary biology of the parasitic angiosperm Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex Engelm. (Viscaceae). Arceuthobium americanum infects three principal hosts and has the most extensive geographical range of any North American dwarf mistletoe. Based on the lack of apparent morphological and phenological differences between populations of A. americanum, past researchers have found no evidence for recognizing infraspecific taxa. In this study, molecular analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis indicated that A. americanum is divided into three distinct genetic races, each associated with a different host taxon in regions of allopatry: (i) Pinus banksiana in western Canada, (ii) Pinus contorta var. murrayana in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountain ranges in the western US; and (iii) Pinus contorta var. latifolia in the western US and Canada. These observations suggest that host identity, geographical isolation and environmental factors have contributed to race formation in A. americanum. The lack of fine-scale patterning within each of the A. americanum races is attributed to random dispersal of seeds over long distances by animal vectors. Historical factors such as glaciations and founder events have also influenced structuring and genetic diversity in A. americanum populations. Given sufficient time, it is possible that these races will become reproductively isolated and undergo speciation."									33	0	0	32	0	33			0962-1083			WOS:000174424000009	11918778J	"Ortiz, PL; Arista, M; Talavera, S"				"Ortiz Ballesteros, Pedro Luis/G-3099-2015; Talavera, Salvador/G-3387-2015; "	"Ortiz Ballesteros, Pedro Luis/0000-0002-4150-565X; Talavera, Salvador/0000-0002-6173-6754; Arista Palmero, Montserrat/0000-0003-0914-9525"			Sex ratio and reproductive effort in the dioecious Juniperus communis subsp alpina (Suter) Celak.

Sex ratio (male : female) increased significantly with elevation, and above 2600 in it was significantly male-biased. The reproductive effort was markedly greater for females than for males at all elevations. However, over 3 years of study, the growth of the females, measured as elongation of the main axes, was similar to that of the males. In both sexes, growth decreased with increasing elevation. Neither size of the ripe seed cones, nor the number of developed seeds per cone varied with elevation. The percentage of filled seeds was significantly greater at higher elevations indicating more favourable conditions for wind pollination in these stands. However, cone production decreased with elevation and so, reproductive success of J. communis subsp. alpina in Sierra Nevada decreases towards both upper and lower altitudinal distribution limits. The results do not support the hypothesis of differential reproductive cost between sexes; thus, alternative arguments to explain the altitudinal variation of sex ratio are discussed.

The average queen mating frequency (QMF) estimated from the sperm dissected from the spermathecae of 61 queens was 2.4 with 69% of the queens being multiply mated. QMF estimated from worker offspring in a subsample of eight monogynous colonies was 3.5, but the effective paternity (m(e,p)) was only 1.23. The difference between these values reflected unequal sperm use by the queens. Most colonies of R longiseta were polygynous and the average relatedness among workers was 0.35. Polyandry thus added only marginally to the genetic diversity of colonies, and our results gave little support to the genetic-variability hypothesis for explaining polyandry. Diploid male load was low, as only 1% of males were diploid. A large majority (92%) of nests produced one sex only, with males produced in colonies that had higher than average worker relatedness. This contradicted the predictions derived from worker control of sex ratios. Males produced enough sperm to fill the spermathecae of several queens. Thus, the results indicated that diploid male load, sperm limitation and sex ratio conflict are also unlikely explanations of polyandry. Plausible hypotheses for polyandry include mating by convenience, as the sex ratio is male biased and the mating costs to a female can be low because the females are wingless and have no mating flight. The observed unequal sperm use further-more points to sperm choice and sperm competition as important factors in the evolution of polyandry.									24	1	0	24	0	24			0340-5443			WOS:000174228100001	J	"Liu, ZL; Zhou, AY; Rodriguez, E"								Photometric observations of the delta Scuti star UV Trianguli and its evolutionary status								CHINESE JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS				2	1			59	65					Feb-02	2002	UV Tri was observed photometrically from 1999 to 2000 at the Xinglong Station of the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and was also observed with Stromgren uvbyH(beta) filter system at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Spain) in 2000. From period,analyses of the data, three pulsation frequencies, 9.3299 cd(-1), 10.8483 cd(-1) and 3.6035 cd(-1) were obtained. We derived color indices: b - y = 0.215, m(1) = 0.169, c(1) = 0.783, and beta = 2.775. With these indices and some calibrations, we obtain: M-v = 2.44, M-bol = 2.27, logL/L-circle dot = 0.99, and logT(eff) = 3.875. Evolutionary sequences of stellar models with 1.00-2.00 solar masses, at steps of 0.05 M-circle dot are computed. Each sequence consists of 220 evolutionary intervals. From a comparison between the observed and calculated physical parameters we conclude that UV Tri is in an early, evolutionary phase before the turn-off point.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1009-9271			WOS:000174082600007	J	"Zamora, Regino; Gomez, Lorena; Gomez, Jose Maraa; Hodar, Jose Antonio; Baraza, Elena; Castro, Jorge"								Meta-analysis of the nurse effect of shrubs in reforestations in Mediterranean mountains.

The analysis of scats revealed a very important interspecific trophic niche overlap in the mesic habitat. In the xeric habitat the differences were significant and the overlap moderate. Seasonal variations existed in the degree of overlap, which reached its highest Level in winter in the mesic habitat and in spring in the xeric habitat. The results indicated that the availability of food in each habitat was important in determining the divergence of the diets. Thus, in the mesic habitat, competition could be possible, although it was not important enough to cause a habitat segregation. Martens seemed to be more adaptive than foxes, probably due to their smaller size and arboreal life, allowing them to exploit fruit which is not as profitable for the fox. Foxes based their diet on small mammals, carrion and cultivated fruit in both habitats. Rabbits were also seasonally important in the xeric habitat. The trophic niche breadth of foxes was higher in the mesic habitat. The inter-habitat comparison showed significant differences in the diet of martens. In the xeric habitat, martens centred their diet on small mammals and fruit of Juniperus phoenicea, Morus ulmifolius and Amelanchier ovalis, while in the mesic habitat their diet was very similar to that of foxes. The trophic niche breadth was higher in the xeric habitat than in the mesic. The habitat conditions particulary influenced the overlap of the diets and these variations were fundamentally caused by the different availability of small fruit.									29	0	0	29	0	34			1616-5047			WOS:000176123500002	B	"Antoci, V; Rodler, F"						"Sterken, C; Kurtz, DW"		44 Tau: a slowly rotating delta Scuti star								OBSERVATIONAL ASPECTS OF PULSATING B AND A STARS		ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC CONFERENCE SERIES		256				179	181					2002	2002	Three separate data sets of the delta Scuti star 44 Tau (HD 26322), collected at the following Observatories: Washington Camp (Arizona), Sierra Nevada Observatory (Spain) and at the Ege University Observatory (Turkey), were combined and analyzed to determine its pulsation behavior.

The flowers of this plant species were visited by very few insects belonging only to two generalist taxa, thrips and ants. Nevertheless, reproduction is not pollen limited in E. willkommii. Hand-pollinations demonstrated that this plant species is capable of selfing, reproductive success being similar in autogamous and allogamous crosses. Moreover, pollinator-exclusion experiments also showed that, under natural conditions, this plant relies predominantly on selfing, seed production being similar in presence or absence of pollinators. Selfing in E. willkommii is presumably an ecological mechanism to ensure successful reproduction in a harsh environment where pollinator availability is extremely low.									21	3	0	24	0	25			0378-2697			WOS:000175931800005	J	Schulte, L								Climatic and human influence on river systems and glacier fluctuations in southeast Spain since the Last Glacial Maximum								QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL				93-4				85	100	PII S1040-6182(02)00008-3	10.1016/S1040-6182(02)00008-3			2002	2002	The semi-desert environments of the Mediterranean re-ion are most sensitive to climatic changes and human land exploitation. This paper is focused on the Late Pleistocene and Holocene geomorphic evolution of southeast Spain, one of the driest regions in Europe. Late Pleistocene and Holocene chronosequences of river terraces were established for the Antas and Aguas valleys, respectively. The deposition of tip to four fluvial terraces during isotope stage 2 points to important erosion and accumulation processes at the end of Late Pleistocene in the Vera basin. In contrast to the stage 2 deposits, the Holocene terraces are composed of point bar deposits accumulated by meandering rivers with less sediment discharge. According to the obtained C-14-dating and extracted pottery fragments, Holocene terrace deposition occurred during the Atlantic period, early Middle Ages, Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century. The most outstanding site in southern Spain for studying Holocene glacier shifts (up to five end-moraines) is the Veleta cirque in Sierra Nevada, where the southernmost glacier of Europe persisted during the Little Ice Age. The climate changes of the LIA probably are recorded by two glacier fluctuations, as indicated by Pb-210 dating and historical data. The reconstruction of the evolution of the Aguas and Antas valleys stress that the aggradations of the lower terraces is mostly climate-induced although during the last 500 years, human interference in the landscape (Christian conquest, mining boom of the 19th century, etc.) may have played an important role to river dynamics.

Results of these laboratory experiments were related to previous field data. Massive release and detachment of zoospores, which is the dispersal stage of the epibiont, occurred just before molting. A lower number of zoospores was dispersed from the discarded molts and a scant number dispersed during the intermolt period. Release of cysts, which is the overwintering stage of the epibiont, mainly occurred immediately after the molt was discarded. The production of dispersal forms (zoospores and cysts) shows precise temporal synchronization with the molting process in Daphnia. The colonization of uninfected individuals from infected molts and from infected individuals was rapid. Our results suggest that colonization of field animals in this lake is efficient and is facilitated by the coincident aggregates of substrate and epibiont.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0022-3646			WOS:000171736300008	J	"Vivero, Jose Luis; Hernandez-Bermejo, J.

The inter- and intra-annual changes in the biomass, elemental (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and taxonomical composition of the phytoplankton in a high mountain lake in Spain were studied during 3 years with different physical (fluctuating hydrological regime) and chemical conditions. The importance of internal and external sources of P to the phytoplankton was estimated as the amount of P supplied via zooplankton recycling (internal) or through ice-melting and atmospheric deposition (external).2. Inter-annual differences in phytoplankton biomass were associated with temperature and total dissolved phosphorus. In 1995, phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with total dissolved phosphorus. In contrast, the negative relationship between zooplankton and seston biomass (direct predatory effects) and the positive relationship between zooplankton P excretion and phytoplankton biomass in 1997 (indirect P-recycling effects), reinforces the primary role of zooplankton in regulating the total biomass of phytoplankton but, at the same time, encouraging its growth via P-recycling.3. Year-to-year variations in seston C : P and N : P ratios exceeded intra-annual variations. The C : P and N : P ratios were high in 1995, indicating strong P limitation. In contrast, in 1996 and 1997, these ratios were low during ice-out (C : P < 100 and N : P < 10) and increased markedly as the season progressed. Atmospheric P load to the lake was responsible for the decline in C : P and N : P ratios.4. Intra-annual variations in zooplankton stoichiometry were more pronounced than the overall differences between 1995 and 1996. Thus, the zooplankton N : P ratio ranged from 6.9 to 40.1 (mean 21.4) in 1995, and from 10.4 to 42.2 (mean 24.9) in 1996. The zooplankton N : P ratio tended to be low after ice-out, when the zooplankton community was dominated by copepod nauplii, and high towards mid- and late-season, when these were replaced by copepodites and adults.5. In 1995, the minimum demands for P of phytoplankton were satisfied by ice-melting, atmospheric loading and zooplankton recycling over 100%. In order of importance, atmospheric inputs (> 1000%), zooplankton recycling (9-542%), and ice-melting processes (0.37-5.16%) satisfied the minimum demand for P of phytoplankton during 1996 and 1997. Although the effect of external forces was rather sporadic and unpredictable in comparison with biologically driven recycle processes, both may affect phytoplankton structure and elemental composition.									29	0	0	23	0	29			0046-5070			WOS:000170565800002	J	"Gomez, JM; Hodar, JA; Zamora, R; Castro, J; Garcia, D"				"Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011; Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014"	"Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240"			Ungulate damage on Scots pines in Mediterranean environments: effects of association with shrubs								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE				79	6			739	746					Jun-01	2001	"The spatial structure of plant communities as well as the quality and abundance of neighbours can strongly influence the intensity of herbivory suffered by a plant. In this paper, we study the effect of the association with shrubs on the ungulate herbivory suffered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ., Pinaceae) saplings in two isolated, fragmented populations in southeastern Spain. For this, we monitored herbivory on saplings with regard to the microhabitat in which they grew. We distinguished pines growing in open interspaces, on the edge of shrubs and within the canopy of shrubs, and also we distinguished four functional types of shrubs: thorny shrubs, nonthorny shrubs, thorny scrubs, and nonthorny scrubs. Our results show that association with shrubs increases the damage inflicted on Scots pine saplings. In fact, saplings growing in the open patches, far from the shrubs, escaped from herbivory more frequently and incurred less damage than did saplings growing close to shrubs. However, herbivory was also reduced when pine saplings were completely surrounded by shrubs, since then they served as a mechanical barrier. The type of neighbouring shrub did not affect the overall damage suffered by pines, despite the fact that the ungulates damaged the nonthorny scrubs more intensely than the other kinds of shrubs. Consequently, saplings have an advantage when growing within the canopy of shrubs; these constitute key microsites for pine recruitment in these Mediterranean forests."									39	1	0	37	0	39			Aug-26			WOS:000169869100010	J	"Barea-Arco, J; Perez-Martinez, C; Morales-Baquero, R"				"Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014; "	"Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899"			Evidence of a mutualistic relationship between an algal epibiont and its host, Daphnia pulicaria								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				46	4			871	881					Jun-01	2001	We examined seasonality, intensity, and level of epibiont infection by the green alga Korshikoviella gracilipes on the zooplankton community over 2 yr in. the high mountain Rio Seco lake. Daphnia pulicaria was the preferred substrate for the epibiont, whose life cycle was exclusively completed on this taxon. The density of epibiont dispersal stage and the epibiont prevalence and burden on crustacean zooplankton were directly related to D. pulicaria density in both years. Laboratory experiments showed that attached epibionts had a negative effect on Daphnia by increasing the weight and sinking rates of infected animals and a positive: effect by increasing its reproductive rates, with a neutral effect on survivorship. On the other hand, the epibiont dispersal stage was actively and intensively grazed by Daphnia, which implies a benefit for Daphnia and a cost for K. gracilipes. Thus, both species derived benefits and costs from this relationship. Our results indicate a positive cost-benefit balance for both epibiont and host in such a way that a mutualistic relationship can be suggested. This epibiont-host interaction may play an important role in population and community regulation in Rio Seco lake.									27	0	1	26	1	29			0024-3590			WOS:000169214600012	J	"Peixinho, N; Lacerda, P; Ortiz, JL; Doressoundiram, A; Roos-Serote, M; Gutierrez, PJ"				"Lacerda, Pedro/G-4758-2012; Peixinho, Nuno/B-2570-2014; Gutierrez, Pedro/K-9637-2014"	"Peixinho, Nuno/0000-0002-6830-476X; Gutierrez, Pedro/0000-0002-7332-6269"			Photometric study of Centaurs 10199 Chariklo (1997 CU26) and 1999 UG(5)								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				371	2			753	759		10.1051/0004-6361:20010382			May-01	2001	We present the results of visible broad band photometry of two Centaurs, 10199 Chariklo (1997 CU26) and 1999 UG(5) from data obtained at the 1.52 meter telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory at Calar Alto, Spain, during 2 separate runs in April 1999 and February 2000 and at the 1.5 meter telescope of the Sierra Nevada Observatory, Spain, in March of 1999. For Chariklo, the absolute magnitudes determined from the February 2000 data are found to be higher by about 0.27 mag than the average in the 1999 run. This may indicate long period rotational variability and possibly a G parameter higher than the assumed value of 0.15. From the best sampled R-lightcurve obtained in the February 2000 run, no short term rotational variability was found. The V- R colours for this object in all runs are similar to previously published values. For 1999 UG(5), colours were found to be very red: B - V = 0.88 +/- 0.18, V - R = 0.60 +/- 0.08 and R- I = 0.72 +/- 0.13. These results place this object in the group of the reddest known bodies in the Solar System. H-R and H-V are found to be 10.06 +/- 0.09 and 10.61 +/- 0.07 respectively, and its diameter is estimated to be on the order of 47 +/- 2 km.									20	0	0	0	0	20			Apr-61			WOS:000169943200034	J	"Carrillo, P; Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sanchez, JM"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"				Relationship between N : P ratio and growth rate during the life cycle of calanoid copepods: An in situ measurement								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				23	5			537	547		10.1093/plankt/23.5.537			May-01	2001	The mean nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus Lilljeborg were measured to the stage level throughout the ice-free period of a high mountain lake. Our results indicate large intraspecific variations in calanoid elemental composition. While mean N as dry weight increased from 3.0 +/- 1.3 in nauplii to 6.0 +/- 2.1 in copepodites, mean P content showed the opposite trend, varying intraspecifically from 0.98 +/- 0.26% in nauplii, to 0.87 +/- 0.21% In copepodites and 0.51 +/- 0.16% in adults. Thus, the mean N:P ratio increased ontogenetically from 3.3 in nauplii to 13.3 in copepodites and 24.6 in adults. Two ontogenetic parameters, the growth rate and body size, were associated with zooplankton stoichiometry. Among all II copepod stages, growth rate was positively related to %P and negatively related to %N and N:P ratio. A two-part analysis of these relationships, before and after metamorphosis, showed that the nauplii growth rate explained nearly all the variance in naupliar P content. A high P content in nauplii may reflect a high content of RNA, translating into rapid growth rates. Overall, these results tend to support the hypothesis linking specific growth rate with P content for copepods, but these results also suggest that the validity of this hypothesis is robustness when differences in the life history of copepods as a consequence of metamotphosis are accounted for. We suggest that the intra-stage variation in P content is associated with peaks of intensive metabolic activity during the process of molting in copepods, and we emphasize the importance of new empirical evidence to examine this hypothesis further.									40	3	0	41	0	43			0142-7873			WOS:000169251200008	J	"Zamora, R; Gomez, JM; Hodar, JA; Castro, J; Garcia, D"				"Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011; Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014"	"Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240"			Effect of browsing by ungulates on sapling growth of Scots pine in a Mediterranean environment: consequences for forest regeneration								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				144	01-Mar			33	42		10.1016/S0378-1127(00)00362-5			APR 15 2001	2001	The impact of mammalian herbivory on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapling performance was quantified in three native forests located in two Mediterranean mountains, the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza (SE Spain). More than 98% of the damage to terminal shoots was caused by goats and Spanish ibex in Sierra Nevada and sheep in Sierra de Baza. Some 72% of the tagged saplings (n = 619) were browsed during at least 1 year of monitoring (1995-1997). There were between-forest differences in herbivory pressure. Moreover, the herbivory pressure was significantly higher during a dry year (1995) than during wet ones (1996 and 1997). Overall, when browsing a sapling, ungulates consumed almost 30% of its apical shoots, and 85% of saplings were browsed more than once after establishment. As a consequence, ungulates severely affected the Scots pine sapling growth rate, and therefore browsed saplings grew slower than saplings unbrowsed by ungulates. Thus, according to exponential growth equations, the time necessary to attain a height threshold to escape from mammalian herbivores (150 cm height in our study forests) and start reproduction was retarded by the herbivory up to 12 years. Ungulates are a major factor hindering the natural regeneration and conservation of the last relict forests of Scots pines in SE Spain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sulpicius Gallus, Mare Vaporum and Rima Bode deposits. The data have been obtained at the 1.5 m telescope of Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain) by using an imaging spectrometer working in the 0.3-1.0 um spectral range. Principal features of these geologic units are: (a) low albedo, (b) localization at the boundaries between highlands and maria, and (c) spectral properties similar to those of the associated mare lavas. The image cubes have been processed by means of two independent statistical methods: the principal components analysis and a supervised clustering technique (spectral angle mapper). Using these methods it has been possible to identify the areas covered by dark mantling material and to compare the different spectral properties of the four deposits. In particular, two different classes of the dark mantle deposits have been detected on the basis of the spectra. New areas in Sulpicius Gallus deposit having intermediate spectral behavior between highland soil and dark mantling material have been identified, probably due to a mixing of the two terrains.

The plant communities of the high reaches present greater specific richness and diversity (S(mean) = 7.0 +/- 3.4 and H'(mean) = 2.0 +/- 0.7) than do those of the middle and low reaches (S(mean) = 4.5 +/- 1.6 and H'(mean) = 1.8 +/- 0.6). One zone reached the highest specific richness (S = 12, H' = 3.2), which, apart from being situated in the intermediate stretch of the basin. represents a transitional state (ecotone) between the Salix and Tamarix communities. The characteristics of the waters analyzed indicate very high rates of erosion and runoff due to the nature of the soils (easily eroded marls) and to agricultural expansion and mining since the 16th century. The present-day riparian vegetation is not adequate to absorb the nitrates added to the basin by crop fertilization, reaching extremely high values, particularly during the dry period (between 1.2 and 42.5 mg/liter). Sewage dumping at three sampling stations did not appear to affect the specific composition of the woody vegetation, in the zones with watercourses, water salinity was low during the period of greater water flow, but considerably higher in the dry season (the upper limit was some 1.2 mS/m), resulting in a predominance of salt cedars over willows. Three types of saltcedar areas were distinguished: subhalophilous, which barely changes its chemical composition over the season; halophilous, which develops over strongly mineralized waters and markedly alters in chemical composition during the dry season; and hyperhalophilous, where salinity is extraordinarily high and quite constant throughout the year. A direct relationship was found between the dominance of Tamarix africana and abundance of NaCl."									19	0	0	16	0	20			0364-152X			WOS:000089515300007	10982731J	"Casas, JJ; Zamora-Munoz, C; Archila, F; Alba-Tercedor, J"				"Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/K-7050-2014; "	"Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/0000-0002-3037-1529; Casas Jimenez, Jose Jesus/0000-0003-0928-0080"			The effect of a headwater dam on the use of leaf bags by invertebrate communities								REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT				16	6			577	591		"10.1002/1099-1646(200011/12)16:6<577::AID-RRR587>3.3.CO;2-G"			NOV-DEC 2000	2000	Breakdown rates and colonisation of leaves from four tree or scrub species differing in quality are studied upstream and downstream of the Canales reservoir, a dam located in the headwater of the River Genil, Sierra Nevada, in southern Spain. This dam, with hypolimnetic release, displays short-term fluctuations of discharge and nutrient enrichment in the tailwater during the study period. Breakdown rates of the four leaf species studied do not differ between sites, despite the higher dissolved nutrient concentration in the tailwater. This lack of differences is attributed to the potentially high physical breakage of leaves during peak flows that are of higher magnitude at the upstream site. The invertebrate density in leaf bags does not differ between sites, and Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera are the numerically dominant taxa at both sites. With regard to functional feeding groups, the scarcity and lack of significant differences between sites for shredders do not match the trend predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept in relation to the effect of a headwater dam. Possibly, the discharge fluctuations at both sites causes excessive instability of the natural substrate (leaf litter) for the shredder guild. However, as expected, the biomass of collectors colonising leaf bags is significantly higher at the tailwater, which might be explained not in terms bf quantity, but as a consequence of the higher nutritional quality of the fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) accumulated in leaf bags at this site, owing to the eutrophication caused by the dam. Despite the scarcity of functional shredders at both sites, at the community level, the leaf material is significantly more ingested at the upstream site, suggesting the importance of this source of nutrition for the trophic web at this site in contrast with the tailwater, as predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept. This also suggests that caution is needed in using functional feeding groups as trophic guilds to infer system-level trophic dynamics in streams, given the prevalence of generalist feeders among benthic macroinvertebrates in these environments.

In order to determine its frequencies and pulsation modes accurately it was observed at the Xinglong Station in 1998 and 1999, and at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Spain) in 1999. Period analyses were made for our data set (1997) and the data set (1997-1999). From the combined data set (1997-1999), the values of two frequencies are: 16.8493 and 23.0613 cd(-1). From our photoelectric observations, we obtained two physical parameters of SAO 16394: log L/L-. = 1.16, log T-eff = 3.92. We calculated the evolution sequences of stellar models with 1.00-2.00 solar mass in steps of 0.05 M-. and 8 physical parameters of each evolutionary phase. We suggest that the evolutionary sequence of the 1.85 M-. model might represent the evolutionary sequence of SAO 16394. The 30th evolutionary phase of the evolutionary sequence of the model with 1.85 M-. might represent the current location of SAO 16394. Depending on the Q values (Q(1) = 0.0336 day, Q(2) = 0.0246 day) and frequency ratio f(1)/f(2) = 0.7306 we identify f(1) (16.8493 cd(-1)) as the radial fundamental mode, f(i) (23.0613 cd(-1)) as its first overtone.									1	1	0	0	0	1			Apr-61			WOS:000165455400030	J	"Fernandez-Gutierrez, A; Cruces-Blanco, C; Cortacero-Ramirez, S; Segura-Carretero, A"				"Segura Carretero, Antonio/B-6867-2014; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Alberto/M-8512-2014"	"Segura Carretero, Antonio/0000-0002-5564-5338; "			Sensitive determination of inorganic anions at trace levels in samples of snow water from Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) by capillary ion electrophoresis using calix[4]arene as selective modifier								CHROMATOGRAPHIA				52	07-Aug			413	417		10.1007/BF02535712			Oct-00	2000	A highly sensitive and selective capillary ion electrophoretic (CIE) method has been established to show the applicability of this separation technique to the determination of some of the onions usually found in water samples.

The study was carried out in July, and primarily focused on diet selection. Food availability, diet composition, species selection indices, and the effect of plant availability and chemical composition on diet selection in each zone were analysed. In the high zone, the availability of herbaceous resources was much greater than that of woody species, while in the mid-altitude zone, both resource types were almost equally abundant. Resource availability in both zones had a 36% index of similarity. Herbaceous plants were the predominant dietary component in both zones, and diet similarity was 51%. The greater similarity found between the two diet compositions than between the two resource availabilities revealed preferences for common species in both zones. The Spanish ibex selected food items with moderate levels in diet composition, a degree of quality (high protein content and digestibility) and moderate availability. In the high zone, the ibex selected its diet according to the protein content, while in the mid-altitude zone the food choice was mainly influenced by availability. Spatial heterogeneity probably influenced the difference detected in terms of the feeding strategy used in each area.									10	0	0	9	0	11			Jan-51			WOS:000089831100004	J	"Garcia, D; Zamora, R; Hodar, JA; Gomez, JM; Castro, J"				"Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011; Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014"	"Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240"			Yew (Taxus baccata L.) regeneration is facilitated by fleshy-fruited shrubs in Mediterranean environments								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				95	1			31	38		10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00016-1			Aug-00	2000	Yew Taxus baccata is catalogued as a species endangered and prone to extinction in the Mediterranean mountains of southern Spain, due to the small size and senescent status of most populations. In this paper, we study the effects of herbivory and the protective role of woody shrubs in the regeneration ability of the yew in the Sierra Nevada. The estimated density of the yew in the study plot was 287.9 individuals/ha, more than 90% being juveniles (seedlings and saplings), which were mostly located under fleshy-fruited shrubs. Saplings suffered serious herbivore damage when unprotected by shrubs. Thus, fleshy-fruited shrubs proved to be the best habitat fur seedling establishment and sapling survival and growth. The abundance of fleshy-fruited shrubs in our study site provides a yew population characterized by an active regeneration under natural conditions. We suggest that the maintenance of healthy populations of yew in Mediterranean mountains is strongly dependent on the conservation of well-developed fleshy-fruit understories and their community of avian dispersers.

This system allows the 19 movements of the instrument to run by using high-level software, a ""master"" board, and 19 ""slave"" boards. The Astrophysique Lineal et BIdimensional par REseaux Optiques (ALBIREO) spectrograph has three working modes and is installed in the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. We describe a low-cost system realized for the automatization of a multifunction spectrograph. It allows the control of a large number of motors: 19 for Albireo; the theoretical limit is 32 768! Another advantage of this architecture based on ""slave"" boards is to supply each motor with exactly the current it needs to reach the required torque (reliability and repetitivity of motions are obtained when the motor torque is at least twice the resistant torque). Thus, we can avoid unnecessary overheating which would be detrimental to the material as well as to the local image quality (seeing). The reliability of the system is obtained by software filtering the commands and also by using optocoupled electronics to avoid interference. For a complex instrument, the high-level software must be user friendly. The efficiency of the present software in this respect has been appreciated since first being used on the telescope. This system may be of interest to laboratories and observatories with similar needs for automation of motions. The adoption of this system will be supported by the IAA Laboratory, Granada, Spain.

High endemism areas in the Iberian Peninsula								Belgian Journal of Entomology				2	1			47	57					12-May-00	2000	A comparison between different groups of organisms in the Iberian Peninsula was made to establish and analyse the high endemism areas and patterns of endemism within this territory. The analysis was based on distribution maps of endemic species of the following groups: monocotiledons (Monocotyledoneae), amphibians (Amphibia) and reptiles (Reptilia), springtails (Hexapoda, Collembola), weevils (Coleoptera, Curculionoidea) and butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera, Papilionoidea and Noctuidae). Distribution data were taken from published records and from the database 'Endemica' that was built for this project. Geographic distributions for each group were represented using UTM maps with a 100 km grid. The areas with a highest concentration of endemic species generally fit to mountain areas. However, each group has its own density pattern of endemic species, and that of amphibians and reptiles is the most distinct when compared with the rest. Relevant areas with a high concentration of endemic species include the Western Pyrenees, Cantabrian Mountains, Macizo Galaico, Sistema Central and Cordillera Penibetica, among which Sierra Nevada is of special interest.									9	0	0	9	0	10			1374-5514			BIOSIS:PREV200200478127	J	"Dominguez Lozano, F.; Galicia Herbada, D.; Moreno Rivero, L.; Moreno Saiz, J.

These areas were obtained from an analysis of a representative number of this kind of endemics and compared with those from previous studies of other plant groups and different methodologies. The analysis of the distribution patterns of this group of endemics reveals a very high concentration in the Baetic mountain range, of which the Sierra Nevada is particularly outstanding, and in the Balearic Islands. These results are consistent with previous studies that used other plant groups (dicotyledons, monocotyledons). However, narrow endemics are of relatively little importance in regions commonly regarded as being of high endemism (e.g., the Pyrenees and the Hercynic arc: siliceous ranges that limit the northern ""meseta"" towards the West and the South). The same geographical units are highlighted in relation to the endangered or vulnerable narrow endemic group, whereby the highest values are seen in the Sierra Nevada and the Balearics, while that of the Pyrenees is notably low. The combined analysis of the areas of narrow endemics and the network of protected areas reveals notable deficiencies in the protection of rare and threatened flora."									4	0	0	5	0	5			1374-5514			BIOSIS:PREV200200478138	J	"Gomez, JM; Zamora, R"								Spatial variation in the selective scenarios of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae)								AMERICAN NATURALIST				155	5			657	668		10.1086/303353			May-00	2000	The effects of multispecific systems containing both mutualistic and antagonistic interacting organisms on the evolution of plant traits have seldom been analyzed. We studied the selection exerted by several species of herbivores and pollinators in three populations of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae) in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over 4 yr by using path analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by the spatial variation in the relative importance of different interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in complex systems.									75	2	0	74	2	77			0003-0147			WOS:000086995000007	J	Rowlings, Matthew								An early morning in the Sierra Nevada, Spain.

These cold episodes alternated with the ones characterized by landscape stability and soil formation. Twelve soils that were formed on pre-glacial surfaces and glacial deposits of various ages were studied in four sectors: Laguna Seca, Lanjaron Valley, Mulhacen Valley, and Corral del Veleta. The soil parent material in all of these sectors was mica schist. Organic matter content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable bases, saturation degree, and pH, were found to be not correlated with the age of the surface. The macromorphological differentiation of the soils, their clay and Fe-d contents, and especially, the clay and iron oxide accumulation indices, increased with the relative age of the surface. In contrast, the Fe-o content and the Fe-o:Fe-d ratio diminished with the age of the surface. During the last few pedogenic episodes, soils were formed by strong leaching and acidification, but with very little chemical weathering. All of these features suggest that climatic shifts during the pedogenic episodes towards conditions less favourable to soil development, in addition to vegetation changes and disturbances on the soil surfaces, which started by periglacial processes, account for the soil evolution of the Sierra Nevada better than time as the only variable factor. The soils did not develop monotonically with time and the sequence of surfaces cannot be regarded in a strict sense as a chronosequence. The soils developed over a series of stepped pedogenic episodes; in each episode, especially in the oldest, the properties of the soils related to weathering could have approached or reached a steady state. Nevertheless, when these properties are plotted against time, a continued increase in soil development results. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Mountainous topography up to 2000 m lines the Mediterranean coastal margin of Cataluna (Spain) despite a crustal thickness of 22 km at the coast. Geometric analysis of topographic profiles indicates a strong link between topography and extensional tectonics. Trends in maximum, mean and minimum elevations show marked regional increases in a SW-NE direction along the axis of the Ebro basin towards the active Amer-Brugent normal fault. From patterns of local relief, characteristics of the fluvial drainage network, location of drainage divides, and degree of escarpment retreat, we distinguish two overlapping areas of mountainous topography, a southern area related to late Oligocene to middle Miocene rifting and a northern area related to late Miocene to Quaternary rifting. The youthful topography in the northern area likely results from mechanical unloading of the footwall of the Amer-Brugent normal fault. In the southern area (encompassing the Catalan Coastal Ranges), erosion continuously renews topography produced by rifting while causing headward erosion of coastal rivers into the Ebro basin. Elevated topography along the Catalan margin derives principally from flexural isostatic rebound due to tectonic and erosional denudation, causing exhumation of the rifted margin. Nonetheless, the height of the mountains and the thinness of the crust suggest an additional component of dynamic or thermal support of mountainous topography, likely buoyancy forces from density differences in the mantle.									31	0	0	1	0	31			0278-7407			WOS:000085315400005	S	"Brunswig, W; Sievers, A; Thum, C; Wild, W"						"Kibrick, RL; Wallander, A"		Remote observing with the 30m radiotelescope								ADVANCED GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES FOR ASTRONOMY		PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		4011				84	92		10.1117/12.387216			2000	2000	The IRAM 30m telescope is located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 50 km to the south of the city of Granada/Spain, at an altitude of 2900m.

Specific objectives of the study were to quantify (i) the intensity of herbivory on reproductive structures of H. spinosa and the consequent loss of reproductive output; (ii) the frequency of herbivory, and how herbivory varied between years on the same individuals; (iii) spatial, among-population variation in herbivory intensity; and (iv) the relative importance of each herbivore species with respect to the losses in plant reproductive output. All plants of H. spinosa (n = 80) were heavily attacked by herbivores in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, where most plants were attacked by different types of herbivores during each year of the study. Plants lost about 50% of their reproductive structures during the study period. However, there was a pronounced difference in the magnitude of damage produced by each herbivore since ungulates accounted for most of the damage, whereas other herbivores caused much lighter damage. Mammalian herbivores appear to be a major ecological factor determining seed production in populations of H, spinosa."									11	0	0	12	0	12			1195-6860			WOS:000088908900006	J	"Real, M; Rieradevall, M; Prat, N"								Chironomus species (Diptera : Chironomidae) in the profundal benthos of Spanish reservoirs and lakes: factors affecting distribution patterns								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				43	1			1	18		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00508.x			Jan-00	2000	1. The taxonomy, distribution and habitat preferences of Chironomus larvae from profundal benthos of reservoirs and natural lakes in Spain are presented. The 114 water bodies studied were medium to large reservoirs and lakes throughout Spain, and were visited on at least two occasions (summer and winter). Out of the natural lakes investigated, Chironomus larvae were found only in one karstic lake (Banyoles), and to date, these have not been found in the high mountain lakes of the Spanish Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada, or in Spain's largest oligotrophic lake (Sanabria).2. Multiple regression with environmental data from reservoirs showed that the density of Chironomus larvae was inversely correlated with water depth, temperature and sulphide content of the bottom water, but positively correlated with alkalinity and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content of bottom water. Thus, the density of Chironomus larvae was higher in shallow reservoirs from the eastern part of Spain (calcareous water and higher PON), but markedly lower in southern reservoirs (higher temperature and higher sulphide).3. According to morphological and cytological characteristics, three species of this genus have been identified in the samples examined: C. bernensis, C. plumosus and C. nuditarsis. Reasons for the absence of other widespread European species are discussed.4. Using canonical correspondence analysis to relate species and environmental variables, C. bernensis showed a significant preference for reservoirs with higher oxygen concentrations in bottom water and lower total reactive phosphorus (TRP) content at the surface than those reservoirs where C. plumosus-type were found. This suggests that the smaller C. bernensis prefers mesotrophic reservoirs and the larger C. plumosus-type (C. plumosus + C. nuditarsis) prefers eutrophic reservoirs. Taking into account the TRP/depth index for those samples collected at depths below the thermocline, and thus, where oxygen can be a limiting factor, C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis were present in reservoirs in which the index was low (< 1:170 for C. bernensis and > 1:800 for C. nuditarsis), while C. plumosus thrived in reservoirs with higher index values (< 1:20). These differences may reflect the preference of C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis for detrital material, while C. plumosus prefers phytoplankton. These observations are in agreement with the depth distribution of each species: C. plumosus was restricted to reservoirs less than 46 m deep, whereas the other two species (i.e. C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis) were found up to depths of 65 and 80 m, respectively.5. Data from a transect (5-20 m deep) in Lake Banyoles are consistent with the general pattern described in reservoirs. In this lake, a high density of C. bernensis was recorded from littoral and sublittoral areas with abundant oxygen (above or close to the thermocline), whereas C. plumosus was scarce in several parts of the lake, especially in oxygen-deficient areas during the summer. This karstic, oligotrophic lake has a low TRP/depth index, and therefore, we expected C. bernensis to be dominant in the littoral, as is the case. Nevertheless, the severe depletion of oxygen caused by meromixis, and the high hydrogen sulphide concentration benefit C. plumosus in deeper zones. Chironomus nuditarsis was scarce in Lake Banyoles and only found at considerable depths.									22	2	0	22	1	26			0046-5070			WOS:000085242000001	S	"Villar-Argaiz, M; Sanchez, JMM; Cruz-Pizarro, L; Carrillo, P"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"		Williams, WD		Life history implications of calanoid Mixodiaptomus laciniatus in C : N : P stoichiometry								INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 27, PT 1, PROCEEDINGS		INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY - PROCEEDINGS		27				527	531					2000	2000						27th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology27th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	19981998	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl LimnolInt Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol	DUBLIN, IRELANDDUBLIN, IRELAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0368-0770		3-510-54052-2	WOS:000089402700090	J	"Perez Martinez, Carmen; Barea Arco, Jose"				Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014	Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487			[Relation between host size and infection intensity of an algal epibiont.]				Relacion entre el tamano del hospedador y la intensidad de infeccion de un alga epibionte.

M. nevadensis sp.n. is characterised by a medium sized body (L = 1.40-1.67 mm in females and 1.27-1.63 mm in males), angular lip region offset by a more or less marked depression, odontostyle 12.5-14.0 [mu]m long or 1.1-1.3 times as long as the lip region width, pharyngeal bulb 106-155 [mu]m long, V = 48-55, pars refringens vaginae with two divergent, triangular to drop-shaped sclerotisations well separated by a more or less distinct sclerotised area, female tail relatively long and straight (93-134 [mu]m, c = 10.4-15.1, c' = 4.0-5.6), spicules 41-47 [mu]m long, and eight to ten ventromedian supplements. M. baeticus sp.n. is distinguished by its medium sized body (L = 1.38-1.80 mm), lip region continuous or offset by a weak depression, odontostyle 13-15 [mu]m or 1.1-1.3 times the lip region diam., pharyngeal bulb 126-158 [mu]m long, V = 49-56, pars refringens vaginae with two adjacent, trapezoid to drop-shaped sclerotisations, female tail (83-126 [mu]m, c = 12-19, c' = 3.7-5.6) tapering abruptly at first, then thickening very slightly and finally tapering gradually to a cylindrical terminal portion, and males unknown. These two species being quite close to M. bastiani (Butschli, 1873) Andrassy, 1959, a compendium is presented of the relatives of M. bastiani together with a comparative discussion. M. similibastiani Zell, 1986 is regarded as junior synonym of M. bastiani.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1388-5545			ZOOREC:ZOOR13700026900	J	"Avila, Jose M.; Romero-Alcaraz, Eduardo"								[Aphodius (Loraspis) frater Mulsant and Rey, 1870 present in the south of Spain (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea, Aphodiidae)]				Sobre la presencia de Aphodius (Loraspis) frater Mulsant and Rey, 1870 en el sur de la Peninsula Iberica (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea, Aphodiidae)				Nouvelle Revue d'Entomologie				17	1			67	68					Janvier-Mars, 2000	2000										0	0		0	0	0			0374-9797			BIOSIS:PREV200100111479	J	"Rieradevall, M.; Prat, N."

Revision of a part of the memnonius-group of Hydroporus CLAIRVILLE, 1806 (Insecta: Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) with the description of nine new taxa, and notes on other species of the genus								Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien Serie B Botanik und Zoologie				101				217	269					Dec., 1999	1999	"Within the memnonius-group of Hydroporus CLAIRVILLE, 1806, the H. memnonius-, H. melanarius-, and H. ferrugineus-subgroups are introduced. The species of the H. memnonius-subgroup are characterised by an angularity of the female gonocoxae. Besides Hydroporus memnonius NICOLAI, 1822, this subgroup includes the species of the newly defined H. normandi- and H. cantabricus-complexes. The members of the H. melanarius- and H. ferrugineus-subgroups lack this angularity of the gonocoxae. The senior subgroup contains Hydroporus melanarius STURM, 1835, Hydroporus longicornis SHARP, 1871, and the species of the new H. necopinatus-complex, from which Hydroporus necopinatus sp.n. is described after specimens which have been incorrectly regarded as Hydroporus cantabricus SHARP, 1882, in the past. The H. ferrugineus-subgroup includes Hydroporus ferrugineus STEPHENS, 1829, Hydroporus sanfilippoi GHIDINI, 1958, and Hydroporus obsoletus AUBE, 1838. These species are characterised by their pattern of the elytra, and a newly introduced feature: the corrugated membrane of the median lobe is extended until the apex, this being in contrast to all other members of the H. memnonius-group. A key to all species of the H. memnonius-group is presented, and their habitus and aedeagi are figured, but only the species of the H. normandi-, H. cantabricus- and H. necopinatus-complexes are treated in detail. Some additional notes on the other members are provided, as well as on species which might be mistaken for species of the H. memnonius-group because of their external resemblance. Of these Hydroporus longulus MULSANT and REY, 1861, and Hydroporus nevadensis SHARP, 1882, are treated in more detail. Descriptions, distributional data and some notes about the biology are presented. Females of Hydroporus brancoi ROCCHI, 1981, have been described with matt surface; now shiny females from Portugal and Spain can be recorded. Hydroporus normandi REGIMBART, 1903, is recorded from Portugal, Hydroporus hebaueri HENDRICH, 1990, from Bulgaria, Montenegro, Hungary, Albania, as well as from Turkey, and H. longulus from Luxembourg, all for the first time. Nine taxa are described as new: Hydroporus brancoi gredensis ssp.n. from central Spain and central Portugal (H. cantabricus-complex), Hydroporus lluci sp.n. from the Balearics, Hydroporus normandi ifnii ssp.n. from the High Atlas (Morocco), Hydroporus normandi ifranensis ssp.n. from the Moyen Atlas (Morocco), and Hydroporus normandi alhambrae ssp.n. from the Sierra Nevada in southern Spain (H. normandi-complex), Hydroporus lenkoranensis sp.n. from Azerbaijan, and Hydroporus necopinatus sp.n. with its three subspecies H. necopinatus necopinatus ssp.n. from Portugal and northern Spain, H. necopinatus robertorum ssp.n. from western France, and H. necopinatus roni ssp.n. from southern England (H. necopinatus-complex). Lectotypes are designated for the following species-level names: Hydroporus obsoletus AUBE, 1838, Hydroporus longulus MULSANT and REY, 1861, Hydroporus celatus CLARK, 1862, Hydroporus productus FAIRMAIRE, 1880, Hydroporus cantabricus SHARP, 1882, Hydroporus nevadensis SHARP, 1882, and Hydroporus normandi REGIMBART, 1903."									12	0	0	18	0	19			0255-0105			BIOSIS:PREV200000293820	J	"Fernandez-Escudero, I; Tinaut, A"								Factors determining nest distribution in the high-mountain ant Proformica longiseta (Hymenoptera Formicidae)								ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				11	4			325	338					Dec-99	1999	In this work we study nest distribution and its determining factors in Proformica longiseta, a high-mountain ant. Four factors affecting the distribution of nests were analysed: nest density, intraspecific and interspecific competition, distribution and density of nest-site rocks, and the mode of nest founding. In general , P, longiseta shows a random distribution which is favoured by the distribution and high density of adequate nest sites, and by little or no intraspecific and interspecific competition for space. P. longiseta shows a rather stable interannual density in the study area, although there is some variation over the active period. Over-dispersion was found on only two occasions, coinciding with the highest nest density. The rocks are not a limited resource and their abundance and distribution have no effect on P. longiseta nest distribution. This species founds nests by budding, but this process appears to influence nest distribution only when plots are larger than 100 m(2).									14	1	0	13	0	15			0394-9370	1828-7131		WOS:000084594700002	J	"Matthews, KR; Pope, KL"				Matthews, Kathleen/G-8773-2012				A telemetric study of the movement patterns and habitat use of Rana muscosa, the mountain yellow-legged frog, in a high-elevation basin in Kings Canyon National Park, California								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				33	4			615	624		10.2307/1565578			Dec-99	1999	"In a high-elevation (3470 m) lake basin (upper Dusy Basin) in Kings Canyon National Park, California, we used radio transmitters on 24 mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) to gather basic information on their movement patterns. Rana muscosa have declined throughout their range in the Sierra Nevada and restoration plans require information on their movement ecology. Our study indicates that R. muscosa had different movement patterns and habitat associations during the 1997 summer period (August and September) compared to October when winter dormancy began. In August, visual surveys found frogs in 10 of the 11 lakes in upper Dusy Basin. During August most tagged frogs moved little (mean movement 77 m over five day periods) and all were found in the lake or adjacent stream where they were originally tagged. During September, movement increased compared to August Frogs moved from the original capture lake mean distances of 145 m, and moved cumulative distances of 315-466 m. By October, frogs were again sedentary (mean distance moved 43 m) and frogs were found in three of the II lakes in the basin. Moreover, mean home ranges (adaptive kernel 90% contours) also were different throughout the summer and were highest for frogs tracked during September (5336.2 m(2)) compared to August (385 m(2)); and October (52.8 m(2)). Before this study it was assumed that R, muscosa over-wintered in the deepest portion of the lake. However, most lakes were frozen when our study ended, and tagged frogs were found nearshore under ledges and in deep underwater crevices suggesting that at least some R. muscosa over-winter in these nearshore areas. In this study, we found R. muscosa in different aquatic habitats over the course of their activity period and that they readily moved between these habitats using both aquatic and overland pathways. The movements appear to be associated with seasonal migrations between summer and over-wintering sites."									43	1	0	38	0	46			0022-1511			WOS:000084139200012	J	"Perez, JM; Granados, JE; Gonzalez, FJ; Ruiz-Martinez, I; Soriguer, RC"				"CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014"	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766"			Hematologic parameters of the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica)								JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE				30	4			550	554					Dec-99	1999	Thirteen hematologic parameters were measured in 52 Spanish ibexes (Capra,pyrenaica) from Sierra Nevada Natural Park, southern Spain. The animals were captured, maintained in captivity, and physically restrained for blood collection. We compared hematologic values for healthy ibexes with animals infected with sarcoptic mites and animals treated for scabies and recovered. Ibexes with scabies showed a decreased number of erythrocytes, a higher mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and increased numbers of band neutrophils. The number of lymphocytes was significantly higher in animals that had recovered from scabies as compared with infested ones. The only difference observed between healthy and recovered animals was in the number of monocytes, which remained significantly higher in animals that had recovered From scabies.

The differences found in the eggs and in the larvae are of such an importance that a new taxonomic approach of boabdil, being a species on its own, is a matter without doubt. The position of the Moroccan aksouali (Wyatt, 1952) and dentata (Staudinger, 1871) fron the SW. of France and NW. of Spain remain questionable as long as their first instars remain uncompared with those of the nominal arethusa.

The significant uplift produced, over 3500 m, has caused considerable thinning, detachments and gravitational slides in the Alpujarride units. The general displacements of these movements are towards the WNW to SSW. On the whole, the morphology is fan-like, adapting itself to the border of the Sierra Nevada. This border contains normal conjugate NW-SE and N-S to NNE-SSW faults, the latter also with sinistral strike-slip character. These faults have accommodated the uplift of the Sierra Nevada within an almost N-S compressive context and linked E-W extension. This sector coincides with the western boundary of the Nevado-Filabride complex and, in its southern continuation, with the western limit of the lower Alpujarride units, seeming to indicate a fault (or faults) reaching deep into the basement. Uplift has taken place unevenly over the last few million years, with three noteworthy periods: during the deposition of the Block Formation in the Late Tortonian, towards the Early?-Middle Pleistocene, and in the Middle?-Late Pleistocene. This has resulted in considerable deepening of the fluvial net surrounding Sierra Nevada at the present time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chlorophyll a, TN, and TP increased, whereas the TN:TP ratio fell substantially between the two periods, reaching values generally between 25 and 10 (by weight). On the contrary, DIN, SRP, and DIN:SRP ratios were similar for both periods in each lake. DIN:SRP ratios generally ranged from 5 to 20 (by weight). This ratio was low in the lakes with small catchment areas and increased progressively with catchment basin size. A regression analysis for the smallest catchments showed that chlorophyll a concentrations were not accounted for by variability in TP concentration. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the influence of episodes of Saharan dust, rich in P, reaching the Southern Mediterranean area.									38	0	0	26	0	38			0706-652X			WOS:000083494700011	J	"Martin-Vivaldi, M; Palomino, JJ; Soler, M; Martinez, JG"				Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014	Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620			Song strophe-length and reproductive success in a non-passerine bird, the Hoopoe Upupa epops								IBIS				141	4			670	679		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1999.tb07375.x			Oct-99	1999	Hoopoe Upupa epops males produce a very simple song, with a repertoire size of one, in which the main difference between different strophes of a male and between the songs of different males is the number of elements they include (strophe-length). In several passerine species it has been shown that strophe-length is a sexually selected trait that reflects male quality and correlates with reproductive success. Here we analyse whether in a non-passerine, the Hoopoe, strophe-length of males is correlated with several variables of their reproductive success. Females paired with males singing long strophes laid their first clutch earlier, produced larger first clutches and laid second clutches after a successful first one more frequently than those paired with males singing short strophes. Moreover, males with long strophes produced more fledglings in their first clutches and in the whole season, partly because they brought more food for the brood than males with short strophes. The relationships found are not mediated by age effects. Previously we have shown that Hoopoe females in the early spring are attracted preferentially to songs with long strophes. Here we show that males singing long strophes also obtain postpairing benefits in terms of reproductive success, and that females paired with these males obtain direct benefits because these males provide greater feeding effort in the second half of the nestling period. These findings support the hypothesis that in the Hoopoe, strophe-length is a sexually selected cue under direct selection.									14	0	0	13	0	15			0019-1019			WOS:000083027000013	J	"Novoa, Francisco; Baselga, Andres"					Baselga, Andres/0000-0001-7914-7109			"[Carabidae of west central Rif; Morocco (Coleoptera)]"				"Los Carabidae del Rif centro occidental; Marruecos (Coleoptera)"				Nouvelle Revue d'Entomologie				16	4			311	325					Octobre-Decembre, 1999	1999	A total of 147 species of Carabidae (Coleoptera) are quoted from the central and western part of the Rif Mountains in Morocco.

After collection, the batches were stored singly in test tubes closed with foam stoppers under laboratory conditions at 20-25 degrees C. The number of eggs in each egg-batch varied between 37 and 312 and the length of the batches between 0.6 and 4.2 cm. Independently of the pine species infested, seven to nine rows of eggs were counted, wrapped around one pair of needles. A correlation was found between number of eggs and the product of number of egg rows and length of egg-batches (82% < r(2) < 97%). Oviposition almost always started from the base towards the tip of the needles. The egg parasitoids that emerged were counted daily, removed and identified. Later in the year of oviposition, after the end of the period of emergence of the parasitoids, the scale cover of the egg-batches were removed. One year later, all eggs were opened and the contents, such as parasitoid meconia and remains of caterpillars, were determined. The hatching rate of the caterpillars varied from 47.2 to 79.7%. The rate of parasitism fluctuated between 11.3 and 31.7%, but 44% of parasitoids died before successful emergence. Four species of Chalcidoidea were identified: Baryscapus servadeii (Dom.), Ooencyrtus pityocampae (Mercet), Anastatus bifasciatus (Fonsc.) and Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii and O. pityocampae the most abundant species, followed by Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii emerged mainly in June and O. pityocampae in April or June, depending on the region. For A. bifasciatus only males, and for B. servadeii females emerged except one male. In O. pityocampae, a relatively high percentage of males (5.4-10.4%) was found.									17	0	0	17	0	17			0931-2048			WOS:000083120000001	J	"Hader, DP; Lebert, M; Marangoni, R; Colombetti, G"					Marangoni, Roberto/0000-0002-6603-6984			ELDONET - European Light Dosimeter Network hardware and software								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				52	01-Mar			51	58		10.1016/S1011-1344(99)00102-5			SEP-OCT 1999	1999	A three-channel dosimeter has been developed to measure solar radiation in the UV-B (280-315 nm), UV-A (315-400 nm) and PAR (400-700 nm) wavelength bands.

The soils (Entic Cryumbrept, Typic Xerochrept, Pachic Cryoboroll and Typic Cryorthent) showed mineralogical discontinuities, exchangeable Ca:Mg ratios greater than 1 and a pH and base saturation profile that decreases in the central and lower parts of the solum. The different soil particle-size fractions had similar mineral compositions (X-ray diffraction [XRD] acid infrared [IR] techniques) retaining unstable phases (amphibole, feldspar, serpentine). Inherited or slightly transformed phyllosilicates (serpentine, mica, chlorite, talc and interstratified phases) were shown to be dominant in the clay fraction. The scant pedogenic evolution contrasted with a high free iron content. The concentrations in fine earth of DTPA-Zn, -Cu, -Mn, -Co, -Cr, -Ni and -Fe were not toxic, showed interdependence and were related to the silt, clay and free forms content. The gravel fraction revealed significant amounts of free iron and available microelements (DTPA-extractable), which could be bound to deposits of precipitated secondary forms and to finer pedogenic material present in the fragments. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations confirmed these morphological characteristics in serpentinite and amphibolite pebbles.									4	0	0	4	0	4			Aug-71			WOS:000082807000005	J	Bohn, Horst								Revision of the carpetana-group of Phyllodromica Fieber from Spain, Portugal and France (Insecta, Blattaria, Blattellidae, Ectobiinae).

Morphometric and physico-chemical features along with the composition of plankton, Molluscs and Ostracods are reported. Water mineralization of these water bodies is very low (maximal conductivity 170 muS.cm-1), bicarbonate and calcium being their main ionic contents which result from the lime watersheds. Cattle is likely to increase the eutrophic status of these lakes and ponds, such status being highest in Redonda and Cabeiro, followed by Cerveriz lake. 53 phytoplankton-, 33 rotifer-, 30 crustacean- (including 5 ostracods) and 7 mollusc species are reported. Greens, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms dominate phytoplankton, whereas the rotifer Keratella cochlearis (Gosse, 1851), Asplanchna priodonta Gosse 1851, Filinia terminalis (Plate, 1886), Euchlanis dilatata Ehrenberg 1832, Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin 1943 and crustacean Chydorus sphaericus (Muller, 1776), Daphnia longispina (Muller, 1776), Alona quadrangularis (Muller, 1776), Cyclops abyssorum G.

Molluscs Pisidium personatum Malm, 1855, P. subtruncatum Malm, 1855 and P. milium Held, 1836 and ostracods Heterocypris barbara (Gauthier and Brehm, 1928) and Plesiocypridopsis newtoni (Brady and Robertson, 1870) are new record for Asturias. Regarding plankton composition, these lakes are closer to those of the Pyrenees and Alps mountains as compared whit Sierra Nevada lakes in Southern Spain.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0366-3272			BIOSIS:PREV200000071284	J	[Anonymous]								XXVII International Meeting on Fundamental Physics - Sierra Nevada (Granada), Spain - February 1-5, 1999 - Preface								ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B				30	7			U5	U5					Jul-99	1999										0	0	0	0	0	0			0587-4254			WOS:000081697000001	J	[Anonymous]								XXVII International Meeting on Fundamental Physics - Sierra Nevada (Granada), Spain - February 1-5, 1999 - Preface								ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B				30	7			NIL_5	NIL_5					Jul-99	1999										0	0		0	0	0			0587-4254			CCC:000081697000001	J	"Martin, J.; Gurrea, P."								Speciation areas in Spain and Portugal								Boletin de la Asociacion Espanola de Entomologia				23	01-Feb			83	103					June, 1999	1999	A revisison of the publications of the Asociacion espanola de Entomologia and the Sociedade portuguesa de Entomologia was made to spot the areas where new species were described. We used this information to define the areas with a high level of speciation (endemicity). From the new species described only the ones from Ibero-Balearic and Macaronesian areas were taken into account (Iberian Peninsula and Balearic, Canarian and Azores Islands). The new species cover a wide range of taxonomic groups and geographic locations. During the 20 years covered by our study species were described from most of the insects orders and also other groups within the Hexapoda, Uniramia, Crustacea and Chelicerata. Most of the descriptions are based on material collected recently, and only a few use older material from museums or other research institutions. The description of new species is not restricted to typical high endemicity areas like the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, Azores or the Canary Islands, but includes many localities from most of the considered areas. The place where specialists are based has great importance in the biodiversity knowledge of a given geographic area.									7	0		7	0	7			0210-8984			BIOSIS:PREV200000051593	J	"Martin-Garcia, JM; Delgado, G; Parraga, JF; Gamiz, E; Delgado, R"				Parraga, Jesus/L-1042-2014				Chemical, mineralogical and (micro)morphological study of coarse fragments in Mediterranean Red Soils								GEODERMA				90	01-Feb			23	47		10.1016/S0016-7061(98)00096-2			Jun-99	1999	"We studied the gravels derived from mica schists and micaceous quartzites of three Mediterranean Red Soils (Haploxeralf and Cryoboralf) from the Sierra Nevada (Andalusia, Spain) with emphasis on the following aspects: morphology (visual evidence of weathering, thin section description and scanning electron microscopy); composition (X-ray diffraction, extractable Fe, Al and Si, and electron microprobe analysis); and chemistry (pH, cation exchange capacity, specific surface area and organic carbon content). The gravels had undergone considerable modification during weathering in soil. A loss of the primary rock structure was detected, together with a decrease in compactness, an increase in roundness, color value and chroma. Neoformed kaolinite was present and relatively high contents of extractable forms of iron, aluminium and silica (citrate-dithionite and oxalate) were detected. From an analytical point of view, the surface properties (CEC and SSA) increased and the equilibrium pH decreased in the clasts which had undergone most weathering. The SEM study shows that the fabric changes from laminar schistose in the parent rock to other types in the gravels due to the weathering process. Electron microprobe analysis revealed the presence of phyllosilicates together with iron oxides in the illuvial infilling materials of fissures in the most altered clasts. These infillings affect the properties of the coarse fragments. The relationship detected between the properties of fine earth and those of the gravel fractions suggest that the coarse fragments have a significant influence on the properties of the soil.

For two years, we performed field experiments to analyse fruit selection by birds, offering birds different types of anomalous fruits (unripe, aborted, pulp-sucker infested and seed-predator attacked) and comparing the removal rate to that of ripe, healthy, control fruits. In addition, ne studied the proportion of fruits attacked by the seed predator in samples of fruits which, after manipulation and rejection by birds, we found lying underneath plants. We compared these data to values in samples of fruits which we took directly From plants. Finally, over four years, the abundance of predispersal-depredated seeds in the seed rain dispersed by birds was compared with the abundance in seeds taken directly from plants. Fruit-choice experiments showed that unripe, aborted and Fruits attacked by pest insects (both pulp sucker and seed predator) were strongly counterselected by these frugivorous birds. The proportion of fruits attacked by seed-predator in the sample of fruits manipulated and rejected was significantly higher than in the fruits taken from plants. For all study years, the proportion of depredated seeds was significantly lower in the sample of seeds dispersed by birds than in the sample of seeds taken from plants. Bird response to pests was not categorically to accept or reject fruit, but rather was influenced by pest density. Birds showed two different levels of fruit selection, depending on the type of fruit: visual discrimination, against Fruits that are unripe, aborted and infested by the pulp sucker: and within-beak discrimination, against fruits attacked by the seed predator. In the study, both pests either died or left the fruit when ripe, and therefore frugivorous birds did not interfere directly with frugivorous insects. On the contrary, insects did interfere indirectly with birds, promoting the rejection of pest-attacked fruits by birds. Bird dispersers overcame the predispersal interference of pest fruit damage and Fruit abortion and increased the proportion of healthy seeds in the seed rain. This fact, together with the great quantity of seeds dispersed by birds, reinforces the importance of birds as plant mutualists.									28	0	0	24	0	28			0030-1299			WOS:000080969400016	J	"Fuertes, Esther; Acon, Margarita"								Revision and chorology of genus Mnium Hedw.

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system."									106	0	0	106	5	112			Dec-58			WOS:000082154300006	J	"Jenkins, TM; Diehl, S; Kratz, KW; Cooper, SD"				Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013				Effects of population density on individual growth of brown trout in streams								ECOLOGY				80	3			941	956		"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0941:EOPDOI]2.0.CO;2"			Apr-99	1999	"Some studies suggest that lotic populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are regulated through density-dependent mortality and emigration to the extent that mean growth rates of resident survivors are unrelated to trout densities. To test this, we studied the relationship between density and growth, mortality, and emigration of brown trout in two alpine streams and a set of stream channels in eastern California. We sampled trout at the scale of ""segments"" (5-31 m long riffles, runs, and pools) and ""sections"" (340-500 m in length) of Convict Creek over a 3-yr period. Trout were also sampled during 6 yr in seven 90-m sections of Mammoth Creek. For 2 yr, we manipulated trout densities in Convict Creek by removing trout from two sections and adding trout to two other sections. We also manipulated densities in seven 50-m stream channels, using a natural size distribution of trout in one year and underyearlings only in a second year.In both streams, average size (body length or mass) of underyearlings in fall was negatively related to trout density and was furthermore affected by sampling location and year. The strong, negative relationship between individual mass and density of trout could be detected at the spatial scale of whole sections, but not at the scale of individual segments. The Convict Creek and stream channel experiments also revealed strong negative effects of density on average mass of underyearlings in fall, and on proportional mass increase of yearling and older trout from spring to fall. In contrast, mortality and emigration were unrelated to initial stocking densities in the channels. In all our data, the negative effects on growth were most pronounced at densities <1 trout/m(2) and the growth-density relationships were well described by negative power curves. Large individuals were always less affected by increasing trout density than were small individuals, suggesting a competitive advantage of large over small trout that increased with density.We conclude that individual growth of brown trout in streams can be affected by trout density to an extent that suggests a substantial influence on population regulation. Results from our multiyear, multiscale, and experimental study indicate that density dependence in the growth of stream salmonids will be difficult to detect in purely observational data, especially in systems with relatively high fish densities (where the growth-density relationship has a flat slope), when data are collected and analyzed at small spatial scales, and when insufficient information is collected to assess the contribution of interannual variation in growth."									184	0	0	185	0	187			Dec-58			WOS:000082154300017	J	"De Figueroa, JMT; Sanchez-Ortega, A"				Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/K-8143-2014	Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-1616-9815			Imaginal feeding of certain Systellognathan stonefly species (Insecta : Plecoptera)								ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				92	2			218	221					Mar-99	1999	The digestive contents of adult males and females of 4 species of Systellognathan stoneflies were studied and analyzed: Perla marginata (Perlidae), Isoperla grammatica and I. nevada (Perlodidae) and Chloroperla nevada (Chloroperlidae).

The number of elements per strophe (strophe length) is the only difference between strophes of the same male, and the main difference between males. The function of this song was analysed in a colour-ringed population of Hoopoes in Granada, southern Spain, by monitoring the pattern of male song activity and response to an experimental song throughout the breeding season. Both spontaneous songs and responses to playback experiments decreased after the onset of egg-laying, and song production was not associated with feeding sites or nest holes. Moreover, some of the breeding males that had lost their females resumed singing, Males also used song to recover lost contacts with their mates. These findings suggest that the principal function of song in the Hoopoe is intersexual, for attracting females, and that, in an intrasexual context, its use is restricted to defence of mates. The dual function of Hoopoe song suggests that it provides information both for males and females, probably about male quality.									5	0	0	6	0	6			Jun-57			WOS:000079518500011	J	"Rivera, D; Obon, C; Alcaraz, F; Llorach, R"				"llorach, rafael/D-4729-2014; Obon, Concepcion/L-1977-2014; Rivera, Diego/K-4209-2014; ALCARAZ, FRANCISCO/L-6905-2014"	"llorach, rafael/0000-0002-5215-4445; Obon, Concepcion/0000-0002-0244-601X; Rivera, Diego/0000-0001-6889-714X; ALCARAZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0003-3254-2691"			Systematics of the high mountain taxa of the genus Sideritis L. section Sideritis, subsection Fruticulosae Obon & D.

The group of high altitude taxa of this section is polyphyletic and has been taxonomically divided in different subsections in which these taxa appear normally associated with low-lying planitiary ones, the latter being the probable ancestors. The subsections comprising high altitude taxa are: subsect. Gymnocarpae, subsect. Fruticulosae; subsect. Hyssopifoliae, subsect. Luridae; subsect. Borgiae and subsect. Aranensis. Most of the high altitude taxa of section Sideritis are endemics with small distribution areas; they are incompletely known and threatened with extinction. The upper altitude limit of this section is attained at over 3000 m in Sierra Nevada (Spain) by Sideritis glacialis Boiss., which has been included in subsect. Fruticulosae Obon and D. Rivera. The taxonomy of this complex group of high altitude endemic taxa of Sideritis subsection Fruticulosae is discussed on the basis of macromorphological and micro-morphological characters.

For this, we compared the age structure of these Mediterranean populations with those of northern Spain (Atlantic), and, on a local scale, the populations of different habitats within the Sierra Nevada. The populations from northern Spain showed age structures with high proportions at young stages. In contrast, the Mediterranean populations proved to be dominated by adult and senescent individuals, except for the few habitats with higher water availability during the summer, which have larger proportions of seedlings and juveniles. Dry habitats showed a lower seedling survival rate than did wet ones, mainly due to summer drought. Both the difference between Atlantic and Mediterranean categories, and the difference between habitats in Sierra Nevada reflect a serious limitation on recruitment of J. communis in Mediterranean mountains due to climatic stress imposed by summer drought. The Mediterranean populations provide a clear example of remnant dynamics, surviving for long periods due to great individual longevity which partially offsets losses to unfavourable environmental conditions. The low ability to recover after anthropic disturbances emphasizes the need for conservation of J. communis populations in southeastern Spain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The call is composed of a variable number (mode = 3) of diphasic sequences. The first sequence is longer, and contains more beats than the following ones. The number of beats per second increases during phase I of each sequence. The time between phases is less than 0.03 seconds while the time between two sequences varies from 0.13 to 0.24 seconds. The call of I. nevada differs from the morphologically similar species I. grammatica (Poda, 1761), whose call has been previously studied by other authors. The call of I. nevada contains fewer diphasic sequences than I. grammatica and its first sequence is different from the following ones, while all of the sequences of I. grammatica are similar. These behavioural characters support the separation of both species. The male mating call of I. nevada can be considered to be a derived pattern of drumming, and one of the most complex known in Isoperla.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0165-0424			BIOSIS:PREV199900212916	J	Schmidt, Gerhard H.

Channel fills, parallel lamination, cross-lamination, graded bedding, sedimentary clastic dykes and other sedimentary structures and features occur in the rauhwacke body. These sedimentary rocks correspond to continental deposits of alluvial and karstic origin deposited over a karstified erosional surface of Nevado-Filabride marbles. Although no fossils have been found in the rauhwackes, a Tortonian age for these rocks is suggested on the basis of structural arguments and lithostratigraphic data from the nearby Almanzora basin. The rauhwackes were buried by slabs of Alpujarride rocks that gravitationally slid over them during the uplifting of the Sierra de los Filabres.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0016-7746			WOS:000083698300008	J	"Sinclair, WT; Morman, JD; Ennos, RA"				Sinclair, Billy/F-4023-2010				The postglacial history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in western Europe: evidence from mitochondrial DNA variation								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				8	1			83	88		10.1046/j.1365-294X.1999.00527.x			Jan-99	1999	"The geographical structure of mitochondrial (mt)DNA variants (mitotypes) was investigated in 38 western European populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of total DNA and a homologous coxl probe. Three major mitotypes (designated a, b and d) were detected. Within Spain all mitotypes were found, gene diversity was high, H-T = 0.586, and this diversity was distributed predominantly among rather than within populations (F-ST(M) = 0.813 for the seven Spanish populations). Mitotype d was present only in the most southerly population from the Sierra Nevada. Elsewhere in Europe, populations showed little or no mtDNA diversity within regions, but there were marked differences between regions. Italian populations were fixed for mitotype b; populations from northern France, Germany, Poland, Russia and southern Sweden were fixed for mitotype a; while populations in northern Fennoscandia were fixed for mitotype b. The isolated Scottish populations were predominantly of mitotype a, but mitotype b was present in three of the 20 populations scored.

The taxon powelli is transferred back to Chamaesphecia, its original combination. Two new species, S. hispanica sp. n. and S. maroccana sp. n., are described from Spain and from Morocco, respectively. A key to the Palaearctic species of the S. triannuliformis and S. muscaeformis group is presented. S. atlantis is known only from the High Atlas Mts in Morocco from altitudes between 2000 and 2900 m. Its host plant is supposed to be an Armeria species (Plumbaginaceae). It is closely related and similar to S. borreyi and S. koschwitzi. S. borreyi is known from different localities in Morocco from about 400 m up to 2200 m. Host plants are Limonium species (Plumbaginaceae). S. hispanica sp. n. is represented in many collections but usually has been confused with S. atlantis. It is widely distributed in Spain and is also found in southern France. It occurs from the coastline up to more than 2000 m in the Sierra Nevada. It is closely related to S. maroccana sp. n. and S. triannuliformis (Freyer, 1845). The host plants are various Rumex species (Polygonaceae). S. maroccana sp. n. is widely distributed in the Atlas Mts in Morocco and found at altitudes between 1600 and 2700 m. The host plant is a Rumex species (Polygonaceae). Chamaesphecia powelli comb. rev. was known for certain from the type locality in Algeria only. Recently, it has also been found in the High Atlas Mts in Morocco. It was reared from the roots of a Nepeta species (Lamiaceae). Additionally, S. affinis erodiiphaga (Dumont, 1922) is recorded from Morocco and southern Spain for the first time.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0342-7536			BIOSIS:PREV199900375877	J	"Tinaut, A; Fernandez-Escudero, I; Ruano, F; Cerda, X"				"CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; "	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Ruano, Francisca/0000-0002-9806-7267"			The relationship of nest rock dimensions to reproductive success and nest permanence in a high-mountain ant, Proformica longiseta (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)								SOCIOBIOLOGY				34	1			99	117					1999	1999	"The relationship between the dimensions of nesting rocks and nest abandonment or permanence has been studied in the high-mountain ant Proformica longiseta Collingwood, analyzing the advantages or disadvantages of different types of rocks and whether rock selection occurs in this species, The frequency distributions of available and occupied rocks showed statistical differences for thickness, surface and volume. Thirtynine percent of the ant nests were abandoned before the end of the active season, 16% overwintered once without a change of rock, and 45% overwintered at least two years under the same rock, Rocks protect against extreme temperatures as well as serve as a supplementary source of heat, maintaining optimal conditions for brood development, Rocks thinner than 3.5cm harbored broods for shorter daily periods than did rocks thicker than 3.5cm. The statistical analysis of the mean rock dimensions according to the time of permanence of the nests, showed differences for thickness, surface and volume, The sizes with longer permanence were those with between 2.5 and 4.5cm of thickness and a surface area between 100 and 250cm(2). This kind of rock also proved conducive to the production of sexuals, Thus, for the fitness of the colony, there are suitable and unsuitable rocks. The occupation of the optimal rocks resulted from random discovery by ants, without the availability of favorable nest-sites (rocks) being a limiting factor. When relocation was needed because the rock proved unsuitable, workers relocated the nest under another rock without recognizing or learning to recognize suitable or unsuitable properties, Therefore, there is no prior selection of the rock, The thermal properties of this rock leads to abandonment (if ""bad"") or selection (if ""good"").

We have reconstructed a large, complex fold structure (which can be followed axially for over 50 km) based on a careful revision of the boundaries between lithological formations, a structural analysis of the carbonate and metapelite sequences, and the use of mineralogical techniques such as measurements of d(001) basal spacing of phengite, paragonite and chlorite, determinations of the illite 'crystallinity' index (IC) and b(0) parameters of mica and chlorite. Structural field data described in this paper include gently dipping axial plane cleavage surfaces, common occurrence of gently dipping boudinage and pinch-and-swell structures and associated sub-orthogonal stretching lineation, similarity in orientation of this stretching lineation with the slip direction of the low-angle normal faults, and close association between north-facing recumbent folds and top-to-the-north low-angle normal faults (the slip direction of the faults being broadly perpendicular to the fold axes). These features clearly indicate that extensional processes played a decisive role in the generation of the Alpujarras large recumbent folds. The development of these recumbent folds probably occurred during the Early to Middle Miocene extensional tectonics that affected the Betic Cordilleras. The formation of large-scale folds in association with normal faulting is consistent with the P-T paths and geochronological data established for the Alpujarride region.

The abundance of two insect species - a pulp-sucking scale and a seed-predator wasp - was surveyed with respect both to fruit characteristics and to viability of seeds contained therein. Seed-predator pressure was not significantly related to any fruit characteristics; however, pulp suckers tended to be more abundant in plants with low pulp:seed ratios and high fruit-water content. In addition, fruits with high levels of pulp-sucker attack tended to have higher water content. A multi-factor ANOVA, considering the identity of the plant and the attack of the different pests as factors, showed that plant identity accounts for most of the variation in fruit characteristics. The viability of seeds tended to be lower in plants strongly attacked by both pests. Fruits attacked by seed predators showed significantly lower proportions of viable and unviable seeds than did unattacked fruits. Seed viability was also lower in those fruits heavily attacked by pulp suckers, but this pattern is strongly mediated by plant identity. Pest activity proved to be clearly associated with a direct decrease in juniper reproductive capacity. This loss involved a reduction of the viable-seed number, mainly related to the seed predator, as well as a reduction of fruit attractiveness to frugivorous dispersers, related to the pulp sucker.

Field and regional constraints show that the emplacement of this large, composite, batholithic complex post-dates the main Variscan regional deformation phases (D-1 + D-2 + D-3) and associated metamorphic events. Field, petrographic and geochemical data suggest a strong genetic relationship between most of the members of the FAC. However, their Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic signatures appear to rule out any genetic process involving a single homogeneous source and/or closed-system fractional crystallization of the same parental magma. A model involving hybridization of mantle-derived basaltic liquids with crustal anatectic melts followed by further contamination and fractional crystallization is proposed to explain the isotopic and geochemical variation trends defined by the FAC granitic rocks.

In a study of the endangered flora and its protection, 116 taxa are listed as having the most restricted distribution and as being under threat of extinction. Field work for these taxa was undertaken in order to improve knowledge of their habitats, populations, chorology and main threats. Using the new IUCN categories of threat, an analysis was made for each of the taxa, especially those that are critically endangered with a very low number of individuals or very narrow areas of occupancy. Mention is made of the problems posed by the practical application of the new IUCN categories. The main types of environmental impact affecting the flora are also described, including grazing, natural causes, wetland desiccation and water pollution. The highest-lying areas (oro- and cryoro-Mediterranean belts) are where most of the threatened plants are to be found. Since these same plants are mostly endemic to the Sierra Nevada, the need to protect the high peaks of the area is paramount. Reference is made to current legislation protecting threatened plants and the gaps in the European Union Habitats Directive with relevance to the protection of the Sierra Nevada flora. A number of key strategies for protection are proposed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tectonic control is through the structure and lithology of phyllites and mica-schists with strong lineations providing preferred seepage and failure planes. Climate controls the long-term, seasonal and short-term water-pressure heads. Topography controls the localised head-pressure gradients as a result of seepage and erosion controls the incidence of slope undercutting by fluvial action. The effects of these controls are tested using a hydrological budget model for percolation to ground water, a finite-element model for ground water flows and stability analysis for modelling the actual failures. The results suggest that in this mountainous terrain while climate may be very important for shallow failures, the erosional history and the consequent morphology are in general much more important except for the trimming induced by occasional very large run-off events.

The song of males in this species is very simple, with a repertoire size of one. The strophes of a male only differ in the number of elements that they include (strophe length), and strophe length is the main song feature differing between males. During the prelaying period each individual used mainly strophes of only two lengths, between 2 and 6 elements per strophe, and mean strophe length of males during this period was highly repeatable. However, some males changed the range of strophe types produced and decreased their mean strophe length after unsuccessful breeding or spending long periods of time singing (unpaired males). These changes show that strophe length is phenotypically plastic, and suggest that singing long strophes is energetically more costly than singing short ones. The significant relationship between strophe length and body condition, and the fact that long strophes were associated with longer previous pauses than short strophes, also suggest that increasing strophe length is costly. All these findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that strophe length reflects male condition in the Hoopoe, although it is not clear what the actual cost of singing long strophes is.									15	0	0	15	0	16			0021-8375			WOS:000075480100005	J	"Martin-Garcia, JM; Delgado, G; Parraga, JF; Bech, J; Delgado, R"				Parraga, Jesus/L-1042-2014				Mineral formation in micaceous Mediterranean Red soils of Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE				49	2			253	268					Jun-98	1998	We investigated the processes of mineral formation in three Alfisol profiles of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), with special emphasis on the little-studied process of mica inheritance, particularly as regards its quantitative aspects. X-ray diffraction, conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and geochemical analysis of the soil solution were used, and the granulometric fractions gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, silt and clay were studied, as was unaltered parent rock. Most interesting was inheritance of dioctahedral mica (illites) with small crystallochemical changes. The transition of mica from parent rock to clay was characterized by small crystallochemical changes affecting their structural formulae, reduction of the 2M(1) polytype content, decrease in crystallite size, increase in crystal defects, and other changes in particle morphology. We propose the term 'pedocrystallochemical evolution' for the transition. The changes reverse the processes that take place in micas when rocks are formed by sedimentation, diagenesis and metamorphism. The kaolinite in the soils is a result of neoformation, and acts as the equilibrium phase within the chemical system. Reddening seems to have been caused by both inheritance and neoformation of iron oxides (haematite + goethite).									12	0	0	9	0	13			1351-0754			WOS:000074233600010	J	"Nieto Feliner, Gonzalo; Rossello, Josep Antoni; Fuertes, Javier"								A new subspecies of Armeria filicaulis (Plumbaginaceae) from Sierra Nevada (southern Spain)								Anales del Jardin Botanico de Madrid				56	1			162	164					June, 1998	1998										0	0		0	0	0			0211-1322			BIOSIS:PREV199800474515	J	Medina, Leopoldo								Sparganium angustifolium Michaux (Sparaganiaceae), a forgotten plant from Sierra Nevada (Granada)								Anales del Jardin Botanico de Madrid				56	1			169	170					June, 1998	1998										0	0		0	0	0			0211-1322			BIOSIS:PREV199800474629	J	"Fernandez-Escudero, I; Tinaut, A"								Heat-cold dialectic in the activity of Proformica longiseta, a thermophilous ant inhabiting a high mountain (Sierra Nevada, Spain)								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY				41	4			175	182		10.1007/s004840050072			Apr-98	1998	The activity of the thermophilous ant Proformica longiseta has been studied in a Mediterranean high-mountain environment. An analysis has been made of the biotic and abiotic variables involved, the location of and conditions surrounding the activity, as well as the strategies used by the ant to remain active at high temperatures. The results of this study indicate that the maximum activity occurs during the middle hours of the day and that the variable which most influences daily activity is temperature, especially at the soil surface. With respect to the biotic variables, the availability of food and the demand for food by the larvae strongly correlate with activity. The time outside the nest is usually spent in vegetation searching for food. This activity continues even when the temperature of the soil surface exceeds 58 degrees C. To tolerate these temperatures, the ant not only has a high resistance to heat (critical thermal maximum = 51.1 degrees C), but also increases the speed of its movements and resorts to thermal refuges. The present work contributes data on the biology of this highly thermophilous species, which is also capable of tolerating a long, hard winter and then developing within a short vegetative period.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0020-7128			WOS:000073554600005	J	"Carbonell, R; Sallares, V; Pous, J; Danobeitia, JJ; Queralt, P; Ledo, JJ; Duenas, VG"				"Carbonell, Ramon/A-5729-2009; Queralt, Pilar/F-1915-2010; Carbonell, Ramon/C-7847-2014; Ledo, Juanjo/K-4420-2014"	"Carbonell, Ramon/0000-0003-2019-1214; Queralt, Pilar/0000-0002-4195-4228; Carbonell, Ramon/0000-0003-2019-1214; Ledo, Juanjo/0000-0003-1548-1575"			A multidisciplinary geophysical study in the Betic chain (southern Iberia Peninsula)								TECTONOPHYSICS				288	01-Apr			137	152		10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00289-8			MAR 30 1998	1998	The combined analysis of magnetotelluric measurements, tomographic velocity models and deep seismic reflection images confirms that the Betics orogen consists of the juxtaposition of two crustal domains characterized by distinctive physical properties. At depth these data sets show evidence for a non-coincidence of the petrological and the seismic Moho beneath the Betics chain. The data sets reveal the geophysical properties of the Alboran domain (Internal Betics) and the Iberian Massif (External Betics). According to this, the Iberian crust features a relatively high seismic velocity, is seismically transparent in the seismic reflection images and is electrically resistive. The Alboran domain crust is characterized by a low average velocity, displays high reflectivity in the seismic reflection images and is electrically conductive. The outcrops of the metamorphic complex (Alpujarride and Nevado Filabride), showing relatively high velocities coupled with low V-p/V-s values (1.67) derived from the Wadati slopes, suggest the existence of rocks rich in silica beneath the Alboran domain crust. An interpreted detachment at 12 km depth imaged by deep seismic reflection suggests that these rocks could be related to the Iberian upper crust. partial melts and fluids are proposed to explain the high conductivity observed at deep crustal levels. These would account also for the reflectivity and the low V-p/V-s ratios mapped beneath the Alboran domain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

P-T path modelling in different levels of an Alpujarride unit (the Salobrena tectonic unit) reveals a high-pressure metamorphic stage followed by subsequent decompression at nearly isothermal conditions. Nevertheless, the P-T conditions differ from one level to another. while the top of the Permo-Triassic metapelites includes carpholite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (10 kbar/425 degrees C), intermediate levels are characterized by Mg-rich chloritoid-Zn-rich staurolite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (minimum 10.5 kbar/450 degrees C) and the bottom of the Palaeozoic metapelite sequence presents gamet-kyanite-plagioclase-bearing assemblages (average conditions of 13 kbar/625 degrees C). Thus, the Salobrena tectonic unit represents an entire upper continental segment containing several crustal layers which underwent high-pressure metamorphism during Alpine continental subduction. The decompression, associated with an important mineral growth stage and the development of flat-lying regional foliation, reflects the thinning of this crustal segment, which resulted in parallel disposition of the bedding and metamorphic zones. At low-pressure conditions, large-scale folds affect the regional foliation, producing stratigraphic duplication, metamorphic inversions and the general reorganization of previous Alpujarride sheets. Finally, brittle Miocene extensional tectonics, coeval with the generation of the Alboran Basin, contributed to the definitive exhumation of the Alpujarride complex. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The study was carried out in the Ojen-Marbella region where the Ojen and Los Reales nappes of the Alpujarride Complex outcrop. Ar-40/Ar-39 single-grain analyses of muscovite and biotite display plateau ages of 19 Ma, on the same rocks, Apatite fission-track datings give ages of 18-16 Ma for the last step of cooling below 110 degrees C, and confined track measurements indicate a very rapid cooling between 110 degrees and <60 degrees C. The combination of both data suggests a fast cooling phase at 19-16 Ma with a gradient higher than 100 degrees C/Ma between 500 +/- 50 degrees C and <60 degrees C. This fast cooling was associated with extensional tectonics accommodating thinning of the metamorphic alpine-type pile of nappes, The exhumation rate ranges from 1 to 3 km/Ma during the 19-18 Ma interval and is close to 1 km/Ma in the 18-16 Ma interval. Moreover an uplift of the Ojen and Los Reales units began after the Early Pliocene (5 Ma). The sediments sealing the strike-slip contact forming the boundary between the Alpujarride Complex and the Neomumidian Formation of Early Miocene age contain Early Pliocene planktonic foraminiferal assemblages (Zone N18). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of these sediments, actually outcropping at 150 m above sea level, indicate a deposition in the upper bathyal zone ranging from 200 to 600 m water depth. Our conclusions confirm and precise the exhumation processes during the 19 to 16 Ma interval, and uplift of the Internal Zones since 5 Ma. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

This species shows a nocturnal vertical migration and a simultaneous diel horizontal movement. In the present study, a detailed 24-h sampling program was carried out at four depths in six stations located along the two main transects of lake La Caldera. The results show the existence of diel cycles in oviposition of amictic and mictic (male and resting) eggs of this rotifer. The egg ratio for amictic and mictic eggs increases during the night. The oviposition of amictic eggs was also higher in the pelagic zone of the lake. Oviposition of amictic and mictic eggs was not related with density of H. bulgarica nor with density of competitors (Mixodiaptomus laciniatus). Our results suggest that UV radiation or an endogenous circadian rhythm of activity could be responsible of the diel cycle in oviposition of H. bulgarica.

Nearly 25% of the pluton consists of mafic rocks that mingled and mixed synplutonically with granitic recks. The mafic recks increased, thereby, the overall density of the pluton, added heat to fuel the upward ascent of the pluton, and helped to heat the wall rocks locally and sufficiently for them to deform viscoelastically above and around the pluton. Gneiss and a thin, concentric and conformable sequence of supracrustal quartzite and amphibolite dip steeply inward around all but the northeast quarter of the pluton, which is faulted. These wall rocks define a concentric rim anticline having a steep limb adjacent to the pluton, and a hat limb farther than 2 km radially from it. Previous interpretations of a rim syncline around the pluton cannot be substantiated. Sparse vertical mineral lineations, vertical necklines of boudins, pluton-up sense of shear in shear folds and associated steep faults, and appressed folds in the supracrustal rocks, all within 100 m of the contact, are relict, mesoscopic evidence of upward and outward expansion of the pluton during its emplacement. The macroscopic downward bending of the wall rocks and consequent formation of the rim anticline may be explained either by ductile return flow of heated wall rocks, or by late-stage magma sinking, or a combination of both processes.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0029-196X			WOS:000076710700001	J	"Fernandez-Escudero, Ignacio; Tinaut, Alberto"								Foraging strategies and dietary preferences of a high mountain ant.

We studied the different phases of ovarian development and their relationship to the annual development of the brood as well as with abiotic conditions. The most striking finding is that after egg laying, the ovarioles recuperate slowly over the hibernation period at temperatures of nearly 1 degrees C, becoming fully developed ovaries capable of oviposition by the onset of the active period. We interpret this response as being an adaptation to a short active period as well as a compensation for the absence of a brood during the winter.

Three allocycles of tectonic origin were recognised across which there is a clear evolution from debris flow to sheet flow dominated fans, in connection with a decrease in the volume of fines available in the source areas. The larger volume of accommodation space created by higher tectonic subsidence in the northern sector favoured vertical accumulation of sediment, with the appearance of less elongated fans. In the rest of the system, where subsidence is less, more elongated fans appear, with the development of incised channels and irregular distribution of sediment in depositional lobes. This involves the appearance of markedly asymmetric transverse profiles, as well as lengthy recurrence between the sedimentation events on particular sectors of the fans, where headward-eroding gullies develop. The Lithology of the source area, where intensely fractured rocks are found, is responsible for an important sediment supply and a significant degree of clast sorting from the source area. Consequently, a weak longitudinal trend in particle size can be recognised, which influences the predominance of longitudinal constant-slope profiles and anomalous relations between both fan area and fan slope and their drainage areas. Recent intense tectonic activity has caused the appearance of abnormally low slopes in upper sectors of some catchments, where mass flows are trapped, and the fans present a subsequently higher proportion of sheet flows. Recent piracy phenomena can be recognised in some of the drainage basins, which indicate rejuvenation of the source area, in which case the fan presents a rapid increase in the proportion of mass flows with the development of a segmented longitudinal profile. Due to the recent nature of the processes, the morphometric relations in the fan fed by the basin affected by capture do not coincide with the other fans in the area.

The core-bounding detachment system formed during the Serravallian (15-11 Ma) in an episode of ENE-WSW extension. The ESCI-Beticas 2 deep seismic reflection profile, a transect through the core, shows a highly reflective deep crust overlying a subhorizontal Moho, and a fairly transparent upper crust and upper mantle. The lack of Moho relief beneath this area, with differential values for supracrustal thinning, suggests a mechanism of intracrustal isostatic compensation. Surface geology data together with seismic imaging indicate intracrustal flow and upward doming as a response to footwall unloading accompanying the middle Miocene supracrustal extension. A prominent mid-crustal reflector (MCR) is deemed to represent a decoupling zone between the upper and the deep crust. Subsequent N-S shortening and associated folding occurred in the late Miocene. The interference pattern of this folding over the middle Miocene core produced the current E-W dome-shaped tectonic windows where the deepest complex of the Betic hinterland crops out.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0954-4879	1365-3121		WOS:000075339800006	J			Universidad de Granada						[Collecting insects, why and for what?]				Recoleccion de insectos, por que y para que?

The superposition of structures and the metamorphic evolution observed in the Alpujarride Complex, and in particular in the Adra unit, suggest that these events are as follows: (a) the first thickening event (D-1) results from continental subduction, and is evidenced by the presence of pre-S-2 high-pressure mineral relicts; (b) the thinning and associated vertical shortening event (D-2) is indicated by an almost isothermal decompression during which the S-2 main foliation developed; (c) kilometric-scale N-vergent recumbent folds of the condensed metamorphic sequences, and thrust and nappe-forming in the Alpujarride Complex, suggest that a second thickening event (D-3) took place; (d) the second thinning event (D-4), which affects the whole Alboran Domain, is evidenced by extensional fault systems resulting in the opening of the Alboran Sea.

An approach which integrates kinematic, foliation, and thermochronologic data is advocated, and an example from southern Spain is used as an illustration. AMT ages from the Sierra Nevada are negatively correlated with their elevation precluding interpretation in terms of simple erosive denudation. However, when additional structural data is included in the analysis, a complex denudation history is obtained. An initial phase of tectonic denudation was responsible for the cooling that produced the oldest apparent ages. Thereafter, folding accompanied by differential erosive denudation caused cooling of samples inferred to have been as much as 4.5 km below the detachment. The second phase of cooling began in the late Miocene-early Pliocene.									40	10	0	0	0	47			0091-7613			WOS:A1997XL02100012	J	"Perez-Martinez, Carmen; Barea-Arco, Jose; Sanchez-Castillo, Pedro"				Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014	Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487			Life history of the epizoic chlorophyte Korshikoviella gracilipes (Lambert) Silva on Daphnia pulicaria forbes								PHYCOLOGIA				36	4		330	86	87				S	Jul-97	1997										0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-8884			WOS:000202958000331	J	Fernandez-Rubio, Fidel								[Monstrosities and curiosities (4): the aberrant form of Lysandra golgus (Hubner, 1808).]				De monstruosos y prodigios (4): forma aberrante de Lysandra golgus (Hubner, 1808).

This binary system has been observed during eight campaigns at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almeria, Spain)and at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain). 294 points distributed over the binary period and covering both eclipses are given. The comparison stars used to calculate the differential light curves (SAO 15242 and SAO 15251) were confirmed as being good reference stars with constant flux. These observations are part of a 6 year uvby and H beta monitoring program of low mass eclipsing binaries whose main objective is to provide accurate absolute astrophysical parameters for late-type main sequence stars. Details about the standardisation process and accuracy of the photometry are also given. The internal accuracy of the standard photometry measured as the mean RMS of the differences between standard and observed values for the standard stars observed along the program is only a few millimagnitudes. Detailed analysis of ZZ UMa, based on these light curves, will be published separately.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0365-0138			WOS:A1997XC09900001	J	"Reche, I; Carrillo, P; CruzPizarro, L"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			Influence of metazooplankton on interactions of bacteria and phytoplankton in an oligotrophic lake								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				19	5			631	646		10.1093/plankt/19.5.631			May-97	1997	"Commensalism based on organic carbon supplied by phytoplankton and competition for mineral nutrients are important interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton in oligotrophic clear-water systems. Both interactions are influenced by zooplankton activity. To examine the relationship between algae and bacteria in Lake La Caldera, we studied: the correlations among phytoplankton, bacteria and phosphorus (P) dynamics; the ratio of organic carbon supplied by algae to organic carbon demand by bacteria; and the importance of P remineralized by metazooplankton for both communities. Phytoplankton and bacteria had a similar seasonal dynamics, and there was a significant and positive relationship between bacterial abundance and algal biomass (P < 0.01). However, the release of organic carbon from phytoplankton was usually higher than the bacterioplankton carbon requirement. P available via zooplankton remineralization satisfied between 74 and 316% of the minimum P demands of algae and bacteria. To elucidate whether zooplankton operate similarly on algae and bacterial growth or indirectly influence bacterial growth through phytoplankton metabolism, we performed zooplankton manipulation experiments. High zooplankton biomass in these experiments stimulated both primary and bacterial production, but release of organic carbon from phytoplankton declined. These results suggest a direct stimulus of bacterial growth, so algae and bacteria can balance grazing losses by compensatory growth. Further, the algal decrease of the organic carbon supply for bacteria could, over time, lead to a change in the algae-bacteria interaction from competition to commensalism. This reduction in organic carbon excretion could affect the balance of the competitive interaction."									23	1	0	22	0	26			0142-7873			WOS:A1997XA34300007	J	"Liebanas, Gracia; Pena Santiago, Reyes"								Nematodes of the order Dorylaimida from Andalucia Oriental, Spain.

The zone is separated from the overlying Alpujarride Complex by a crustal scale shear zone that has variously been interpreted as a thrust or an extensional detachment. A suite of 74 new apatite and zircon fission track results have been obtained from the Nevado-Filabride Complex and these have been used to define regional cooling patterns for the complex. Rapid cooling (105 degrees C-200 degrees C Ma(-1)) is spatially related to the tectonic contact with the overlying Alpujarride Complex. Cooling to near-surface temperatures occurred first in the east (Sierra de los Filabres) during the mid-Serravallian (12+/-1 Ma) and was completed by the early Tortonian (9-8 Ma) in the west (Sierra Nevada). There is no correlation between fission track age and sample elevation. These results are consistent with tectonic unroofing of this complex, a finding that favors extension as the mechanism by which the two complexes were brought into contact. Extension spans the middle and earliest upper Miocene (12-8 Ma) in the study area and therefore lasted much longer than previously documented. A hypothesis is advanced which links oblique convergence between the Iberian plate and the Betic internal Zones, resulting in crustal contraction at depth, with orogen parallel extension in the middle and upper crust.									78	0	0	2	0	78			0278-7407			WOS:A1997WT48300001	J	"MartinezMartinez, JM; Azanon, JM"					"Martinez Martinez, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-8178-0904; Azanon, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-7834-5816"			Mode of extensional tectonics in the southeastern Betics (SE Spain): Implications for the tectonic evolution of the peri-Alboran orogenic system								TECTONICS				16	2			205	&		10.1029/97TC00157			Apr-97	1997	"The Gibraltar are, which closes the westernmost part of the Mediterranean basin, is a Miocene A-type subduction are formed by the continental collision of various pre-Miocene terranes in the major zone of collision between the Iberian and African cratons. The hanging-wall block, known as the Alboran domain, has undergone more than 300 km migration from a more easterly position, where it was the continuation of the Alpine Cretaceous-Paleogene orogen. Contemporaneous with thin-skinned thrusting in the footwall, the Alboran domain underwent two episodes of nearly extension in which extensional orthogonal developed with directions of extension NNW-SSE system, orthogonal to the belt axis, in the late Burdigalian-Langhian to a WSW directed orogen-parallel one in the Serravallian. The superposition of these two systems resulted in a chocolate tablet megastructure. This extensional pattern is not satisfactorily explained in previously proposed models for the evolution of the are. Orthogonal extension is plausible in a process of the gravitational collapse of an overthickened crust; nevertheless, orogen-parallel extension is more difficult to explain in this context. We advocate that the WSW directed low-angle normal faults formed during large-scale extension in connection with important westward are migration. The driving force of extension in a general context of convergence is controversial and varies between a removal model and a delamination model. on both the timing and the kinematics of extension, as presented in this paper, seem to support the contribution of both mechanisms. Convective removal may have started the process, but continued N-S convergence could have resulted in westward tectonic escape and asymmetric lateral inflow of asthenospheric material accompanying lithospheric delamination."									90	0	0	4	0	90			0278-7407			WOS:A1997WT48300002	J	"Perez, Jesus M.; Ruiz-Martinez, Isidoro; Granados, Jose E.; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Fandos, Paulino"				Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014	Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766			The dynamics of sarcoptic mange in the ibex population of Sierra Nevada in Spain - influence of climactic factors.

Its principal palaeogeographical characteristics are a large lake in the eastern sector, an axial fluvial system and two fluvial systems transverse to it in the western sector, The uplift of a central sector of the Betic Cordillera during the Upper Pleistocene affected the study area, causing northward tilting from the Internal Zone of the cordillera (Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza), step-faulting of the Plio-Pleistocene infill of the ancient basin (leaving more northern sectors in a lower topographical position), alteration of fluvial current profiles and displacement of the ancient Axial System to a position very close to the divide between the ancient endorheic Guadix Basin and the Guadalquivir Basin. This facilitated capture of the endorheic basin by the headward erosion of a tributary of the Guadalquivir River. The region then began to be rapidly eroded, as the new base level was now some 500m lower than that of the ancient basin. The present drainage network is similar to that of the ancient endorheic basin as regards the location of the main streams and the distribution of drainage patterns and fluvial styles, although flow reversal is found in some stretches and a barbed drainage pattern appears locally. As a result of the inheritance of drainage from the ancient basin, fluvial superimposition is found in some stretches of the main streams.

Each fruit bore an average of 5.4 ovules, of which 4.0 ovules died early in their development and 0.1 aborted. Each fruit sets an average of 1.3 mature seeds. Seed predators invariably infested more than 65% of the fruits every year, killing 87% of the seeds ripened by the plants. More than 90% of the seeds predators were weevils. However, including the other two predispersal mortality factors, we found that the main lass was to ovule death (74% of the initial number of ovules), whereas seed predation destroyed 19% of the ovules. The effect of the plant on the seed-predator survival is somewhat different. Although weevils were parasitized by a wasp, the main mortality factor during the larval stage within the fruits was starvation. Of weevil larvae, 68% died before completing the life cycle because eggs were not laid on mature seed and were unable to enter a seed. As the plant capacity for filling seeds was not correlated with herbivory, the mortality of weevil larvae depended mostly on external predispersal events."									5	0	0	5	0	5			1195-6860			WOS:A1997WQ42400007	J	"Granados, JE; Perez, JM; Soriguer, C; Fandos, P; RuizMartinez, I"				"CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014; Fandos, Paulino/M-7304-2015"	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766; Fandos, Paulino/0000-0002-9607-8931"			On the biometry of the Spanish ibex, Capra pyrenaica, from Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain)								FOLIA ZOOLOGICA				46	1			9	14					1997	1997	Several basic biometrical parameters of the Spanish ibex population from Sierra Nevada Natural Park were studied: body weight, horn length, basal horn perimeter, cross height and total body length.

In western Sierra Nevada, the detachment has been folded and reactivated since the Upper Miocene. A high-angle normal fault system with NW-SE strikes and a general domino structure is developed in the Alpujarride, but does not cut the detachment. The sediment geometry of the associated asymmetrical basins contributes towards the reconstruction of the fault system.									0	0	0	0	0	0						WOS:A1996VM80700009	J	"Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			Intraspecific stoichiometric variability and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus resupplied by zooplankton								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				36	2			363	374		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00091.x			Oct-96	1996	1. An in situ experiment was carried out in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake (La Caldera) to quantify the specific release rates of ammonium and phosphorus in different phases of the seasonal succession of plankton. The zooplankton community was dominated by the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus.2. The rates of release of N and P (from non-detectable to 3.58 mu gN mg(-1) DW h(-1) and from 0.26 to 2.29 mu g P mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively) and the N : P released ratio (not detectable to 4.77) fell within the range typical of oligotrophic lakes dominated by copepodite assemblages.3. The values of the zooplankton N : P ratio (5 : 1 to 10 : 1 by weight) were lower than those established for other species of calanoids, and followed a well-established pattern of seasonal variation from year to year with higher values after ice thaw and lower values as individual size increased (ontogenetic development).4. The elemental composition of the zooplankton depended on individual size, while the released N : P ratio was inversely related to the N : P ratio of the food. This pattern conforms to the predictions of the homeostasis theory of Sterner (1990).5. A feedback regulation was established between the stoichiometric composition of the zooplankton, their food and the released N : P ratio that can help explain changes in pelagic community structure during the ice-free period.									31	1	0	25	0	32			0046-5070			WOS:A1996VM61200012	J	"Galan, G; Pin, C; Duthou, JL"				Galan, Gumer/G-9453-2015	Galan, Gumer/0000-0002-5282-4779			Sr-Nd isotopic record of multi-stage interactions between mantle-derived magmas and crustal components in a collision context - The ultramafic-granitoid association from Vivero (Hercynian belt, NW Spain)								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				131	01-Apr			67	91		10.1016/0009-2541(96)00027-7			SEP 30 1996	1996	Late-stage, epizonal calc-alkaline granitoids of the Hercynian belt are often associated with coeval more basic rocks. Such granitoids have been the focus of special attention when studying the role of mantle-derived magmas in granitoid genesis. These studies conclude that basic magmas are involved in granitoid production but their contribution to the chemical composition of granitoids is often controversial. The Vivero massif (NW Spain) includes calc-alkaline granitoids and coeval ultramafic and mafic rocks, but these granitoids are syntectonic and intruded into middle-crustal levels during an early stage.Scattered major- and trace-element chemistry together with heterogeneous Sr-Nd isotopic results preclude an origin of this ultramafic-to-granitoid association by any closed-system fractionation process. Ultramafic rocks include peridotites, pyroxenites and hornblendites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.5 to -1.3 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)i ratio from 0.7059 to 0.7080. They are interpreted as cumulates formed by ''in situ'' fractional crystallization from contaminated basaltic magmas, particularly by interaction with Sr-87-enriched fluids. Mafic rocks comprise biotite-amphibole diorites, quartz diorites and tonalites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.8 to 0.0 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio from 0.7058 to 0.7073. They represent either cumulates or more evolved magmas of calc-alkaline affinity. These rocks display an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the degree of contamination inferred from isotope data. This points to wall-rock assimilation by thermal erosion during ascent of basic magmas up to the middle crust and supports the participation of mantle sources with positive epsilon Nd-i and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) < 0.7058.Granitoids range from amphibole-biotite tonalites, through biotite granodiorites to monzonitic granites. They show an isotopic trend which diverges from that of ultramafic and mafic rocks. epsilon Nd-i (-6.0 to -1.9) decreases while (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio (0.7061 to 0.7082) increases from tonalites to monzonitic granites, reflecting an increasing contribution of crustal components in more differentiated rocks. Assimilation and fractional crystallization, mixing included, account for such an evolution. Contamination of basic magmas by this process occurring at deeper crustal level produced hybrid tonalites and related matric magmatic enclaves. Only monzonitic granites are interpreted as pure crustal melts. Their HREE fractionated patterns [(Gd/Yb)(N) = 4-5] suggest equilibrium with a garnet-rich residuum. Partial melting of moderate time-integrated Rb/Sr protolith, such as greywackes and/or meta-igneous rocks of intermediate-acid composition, could account for the isotopic composition of these monzogranites.This example shows that at least some calc-alkaline granitoids of collisional settings are not produced by pure intra-crustal melting. They are formed through a complex, multi-stage hybridization process, involving mantle-derived magmas, crustal components and several concomitant magmatic processes.									31	0	0	1	0	31			Sep-41			WOS:A1996VQ33100005	J	"Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			Quantification of the phosphorus released by zooplankton in an oligotrophic lake (La Caldera, Spain): Regulating factors and adjustment to theoretical models								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				18	9			1567	1586		10.1093/plankt/18.9.1567			Sep-96	1996	"Using an in situ approach, we have evaluated the phosphorus inputs from zooplankton in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake. Values of the specific gross release rate (SGRR) fluctuated between 0.2 and 2.9 mu g P mg(-1) dry weight h(-1), and were higher when the nauplii of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus dominated the zooplankton community. The rate of P recycling by the zooplankton was high, reaching 1.6 mu g P l(-1) day(-1), and showed a highly consistent seasonal pattern from one year to the next, with maxima in midsummer. Zooplankton size accounted for as much as 85% of the variance obtained in the measurements of the specific rate of P release, while other factors, such as the quality or quantity of food, did not significantly influence the SGRR changes. Among the models tested, only the one proposed by Peters (Int. Ver. Theor. Angew. Limnol. Verh., 19, 273-279, 1975) was useful for predictions in this system. The stoichiometric model of Hessen and Andersen (Arch. Hydrobiol., 35, 111-120, 1992), applied in this oligotrophic system, adequately predicted the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, whereas the values of P release estimated using this model were far higher than the excretion rates obtained experimentally. These differences were related to the type of egestion (formation of faecal pellets) of metazooplankton and to the relative importance of the food resistance to digestion. We believe that in communities where copepods constitute a substantial percentage of the zooplankton, an evaluation of the P release which is readily available [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), total dissolved phosphate (TDP)] to algae and bacteria would not fit the predictions of general models of mass balance; under these circumstances, assimilation efficiency proves to be the key parameter for predicting the readily available P (excreted P)."									11	1	0	10	0	13			0142-7873			WOS:A1996VL31100004	J	"Douglas, T; Critchley, D; Park, G"								The deintensification of terraced agricultural land near Trevelez, Sierra Nevada, Spain								GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY LETTERS				5	04-May			258	270		10.2307/2997794			JUL-SEP 1996	1996	Changes in the intensity of agricultural land-use have been examined in a mountain environment in the Sierra Nevada, Andalucia. The land-use changes have occurred in response to rural depopulation and other factors since 1950 and have manifested themselves as a deintensification and sometimes abandonment of irrigated terraces which were extensively cropped as recently as the 1970s. The pattern of deintensification and consequential environmental impact is described for one municipio, Trevelez. Ecological changes have been consequent upon the intensity of grazing and the collapse of irrigation systems. These changes have been assessed by rapid appraisal and the implications for the agricultural landscape are identified. Classification techniques using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data have allowed estimates to be made of the areal cover of deintensification.

The pollinator-exclusion experiments show that H. spinosa, under natural conditions, does not produce seed by apomixis or spontaneous autogamy. H. spinosa appears to be self-incompatible but slightly geitonogamous. Thus, this plant species needs pollen vectors for reproduction. The results of the wind-exclusion experiments performed during two different years in two populations of H. spinosa support the hypothesis that the wind acts as a pollen vector; flowers excluded from the wind had a lower fruit set and female fertility than Bowers excluded from all pollinator insects (winged and wingless). This generalist pollination system (insects and wind) permits this species to colonize and sustain viable populations in high mountains, where this species is the only woody shrub living above 3000 m above sea level in the Sierra Nevada."									33	3	0	32	0	36			Feb-22			WOS:A1996UM57200006	J	"Perez, JM; Granados, JE; Soriguer, RC; RuizMartinez, I"				"CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014"	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766"			Prevalence and seasonality of Oestrus caucasicus Grunin, 1948 (Diptera: Oestridae) parasitizing the Spanish ibex, Capra pyrenaica (Mammalia: Artiodactyla)								JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY				82	2			233	236		10.2307/3284152			Apr-96	1996	Prevalence and intensity of parasitism by oestrid larvae in the Spanish ibex Capra pyrenaica were determined for a period of 2.5 yr in Sierra Nevada Natural Park, southern Spain.

Soil variables were measured in 163 soil profiles, collected in a survey of the two soil environments of the Sierra Nevada: the calcareous and silicic zones. Four factor analyses showed that sand, clay, gravel and organic carbon content, and pH were the most useful soil characteristics in evaluating site keys that affect tree and shrub growth (nutrient availability, rooting space and soil water availability). In the calcareous zone, hue, value and chroma color, and pH, were easily determined soil characteristics that established and classified the suitability of forest sites. In the silicic zone, hue, value and chroma, and altitude were the characteristics found most useful in evaluating forest sites.									11	0	0	5	1	11			0016-7061			WOS:A1996TZ36000006	J	Tarrier, Michel								Protection of the Sierra Nevada (Spain) habitats, Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO): The maximum level of destruction has been reached								Alexanor				19	07-Aug			450	454					1996 (1997)	1996										0	0		0	0	0			Feb-08			BIOSIS:PREV199799737209	J	"Dominguez Lozano, F.; Galicia Herbada, D.; Moreno Rivero, L.; Moreno Saiz, J.

We determined several plant and ant traits, as well as the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage. Insects belonging to 29 families and five orders visited the flowers of the plant species studied. In all but two, L. subulatum and G. struthium, the ants comprised 70-100% of the flower visitors. The results clearly show that five out of seven of these plant species were pollinated by ants. The role of the ants as pollinators seems to depend heavily on the relative abundance of the ants with respect to the other species of the pollinator assemblage, ant pollination becoming evident when ants outnumber other floral visitors. The ant-pollination systems analysed in this study may be the result of prevailing ecological conditions more than an evolutionary result of a specialized interaction.									62	1	2	65	3	68			0029-8549			WOS:A1996TV59300014	J	"Brullo, S.; Pavone, P.; Salmeri, C."

These studies focused on water and sediment chemistry and organisms (benthic diatoms, zooplankton, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and fish) as indicators of acidification. Organic micropollutants (PAH. PCB, DDE, hexachlorobenzene and others) in lake sediments and fish have been studied as traces of atmospheric pollution. The Iberian peninsula lakes do not show severe anthropogenic acidification pH values are in the range of sensitive lakes, but the levels of acidic pollutants are low. The status of the organisms surveyed agreed with this diagnosis. Pyrenean lakes showed the highest fluxes of organic pollutants related to fossil fuel combustion, higher pollution-induced versus natural acidity ratios,and modeled alkalinity and pH declines.					5th International Conference on Acidic Deposition - Science and Policy: Acid Reign 955th International Conference on Acidic Deposition - Science and Policy: Acid Reign 95	JUN 26-30, 1995JUN 26-30, 1995	"Swedish Environm Protect Agcy; Swedish Environm Res Inst; Provincial Govt Goteborg; Provincial Govt Bohus IanSwedish Environm Protect Agcy; Swedish Environm Res Inst; Provincial Govt Goteborg; Provincial Govt Bohus Ian"	GOTHENBURG, SWEDENGOTHENBURG, SWEDEN	19	0	0	16	0	19			0049-6979			WOS:A1995UB05300034	J	"MoralesBaquero, R; CruzPizarro, L"				"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015; "	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899"			Effects of fluctuating temperatures on the population dynamics of Hexarthra bulgarica (Wiszniewski) from high mountain lakes in Sierra Nevada (Spain)								HYDROBIOLOGIA				313				359	363		10.1007/BF00025970			NOV 3 1995	1995	We examine the development of Hexarthra bulgarica (Wisniewski) populations in relation to thermal stability in natural environments.

Results show that the intensity of temperature fluctuations has a positive effect on the egg-ratios, as TCR is only correlated with that variable in the shallow lake and SBT is only correlated with egg-ratios in the deeper one.					7th International Rotifer Symposium7th International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 06-11, 1994JUN 06-11, 1994	"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol; Polish Hydrobiol Soc, Rotifer SectPolish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol; Polish Hydrobiol Soc, Rotifer Sect"	POLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL, MIKOLAJKI, POLANDPOLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL, MIKOLAJKI, POLAND	8	0	0	7	0	8			0018-8158			WOS:A1995TR66600047	J	"TOTH, LG; CRUZPIZARRO, L"				Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015	Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704			RESPIRATORY ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM (ETS)-ACTIVITY OF THE PLANKTON AND BIOFILM IN THE HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKE LA CALDERA (SIERRA-NEVADA, SPAIN)								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				135	1			65	78					Nov-95	1995	Quantity and ETS-activity of the plankton and those of the biofilm in the high-mountain lake La Caldera (altitude: 3040 m a.s.l.) were studied in August-September, 1992 and 1993.

In the Alboran domain of the central Betics, the present distribution of the Alpujarride units results from the extensional dismembering of a pre-Miocene nappe stack under brittle conditions. The interference of two subperpendicular and successive extensional fault systems can explain the current geometric pattern of the Alpujarride units: upper-Burdigalian-Langhian north-south extension was followed by west- to southwestward extension of Serravallian age. Northeast of Sierra Nevada, these two extensional systems have resulted in a spectacular chocolate tablet megastructure and the cropping out, at any one vertical sequence, of a varying number of extensional units belonging to the Alpujarride complex. This pattern can be considered representative of the middle Miocene tectonics of the entire Alboran domain in the Betics, and illustrates the development of rifting processes in the upper crust.									44	0	0	1	0	44			0191-8141			WOS:A1995TC65700006	J	"MAYORAL, E; CRESPOBLANC, A; DIAZ, MDG; BENOT, C; OROZCO, M"								MIOCENE RIFTING OF THE ALBORAN DOMAIN - DATINGS OF DISCORDANT SEDIMENTS OVER THE ALPUJARRIDE EXTENSIONAL UNITS (SOUTH OF SIERRA-NEVADA, BETIC CHAIN) - REPLY								COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE II FASCICULE A-SCIENCES DE LA TERRE ET DES PLANETES				321	5			451	453					SEP 7 1995	1995										1	0	0	0	0	1						WOS:A1995RW63800014	J	"Calle Martinez, D.; Vilchez Quero, A.; Casas Jimenez, J.

The size-abundance distribution was dominated by medium-sized phytoplankton cells (Gymnodinium cf. excavatum, Tetraselmis apiculata, Dunaliella spe. and several diatom species), large ciliates (Fabrea salina) and a few zooplankton species adapted to changing temporary environments within a wide size range (Cletocamptus retrogressus, Moina salina, Branchinella spinosa). This polymodal size distribution is compared with results obtained in other systems, including small physically controlled lakes, large lakes, oceans and marine benthos. Consideration of the size structure within homogeneous groups of organisms shows slopes less negative than the average for the whole size range analyzed, a feature which is common in small and physically controlled ecosystems. A seasonal study of the size structure revealed uneven distributions throughout the year, resulting in discontinuities in the size spectra as well as in differences of total size range. There were noticeable differences among the size spectra at each particular time, showing phases of primary producer predominance and phases with a marked predominance of consumers. The time-integrated size spectrum did not exhibit any distinct discontinuity. The influence of extreme shallowness and resuspension on the shape and dynamics of the size spectrum is examined and discussed compared to deeper aquatic systems.									14	1	0	12	0	15			0142-7873			WOS:A1995RZ33000006	J	"PULIDOBOSCH, A; SBIH, YB"				Pulido Bosch, Antonio/A-9071-2008	Pulido Bosch, Antonio/0000-0001-7409-1572			CENTURIES OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE SIERRA-NEVADA (GRANADA, SPAIN)								ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY				26	1			57	63					Jul-95	1995	In the Alpujarra (southern Spain), every year between the March and June, an ancestral practice continues in the form of diverting water from the rivers by way of an extensive network of irrigation channels (acequias) to well-defined, highly permeable areas. This practice, known as cal eos, constitutes an ancient example of artificial recharge. The objective is to guarantee a supply of drinking water during the dry months, as well as improve the physicochemical characteristics of the water. In addition, this system helps maintain moisture in the immediate environment, and thus has a positive effect on local vegetation.									13	0	0	5	0	13			0943-0105			WOS:A1995RJ26000007	J	"Martin-Vivaldi, M.; Marin, J.M.; Villar, M."

The seasonal succession of phytoplankton is characterized by a shift in dominance from eukaryotic species to prokaryotic cyanobacteria, as in a eutrophic lake. This unusual pattern for an oligotrophic lake is related to the release of zooplankton phosphorus, rather than to the amount of total phosphorus. The highest estimated values of this released phosphorus occur during the co-dominance of small-sized species and of one calanoid population, both under natural and experimental conditions. Our experimental results clearly reveal that a blue-green species replaces non-blue-green ones when environmental conditions render low or intermediate values for released phosphorus, irrespective of the grazing pressure. The absence of predators or high levels of released phosphorus stimulate non-blue-green growth. These results agree with the successional pattern observed for the algal assemblage under natural conditions. Nutrient recycling plays an essential role in the maintenance of the metabolism of the pelagic system, and therefore the prevalence of a top-down regulation mechanism as proposed for such low-nutrient environments should be reconsidered.									34	0	0	25	0	34			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:A1995RL65700011	J	"Calle Martinez, D.; Vilchez Quero, A.; Casas Jimenez, J.

Ventral valves of the ovipositor were very short, appearing as two spurs; dorsal valves were longer but still shorter than normal. The specimen had an apparently normal testis on the left side and a well-developed ovary on the right side.Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 2n = 28 + X0 chromosomes in the testis and 2n = 28 + XX in the ovary, the same as standard males and females, respectively, of this species. This suggests that the gynandromorphism occurred at a very early developmental stage. This gynandromorph could have originated from the formation of a binucleate egg by second-polar-body reactivation and Subsequent fertilization by two spermatozoa, one male- and the other female-determining; however, the most parsimonious explanation is the elimination of one X chromosome in a female-determined zygote (XX) at the first cleavage division."									3	0	0	6	0	6			0067-8546			WOS:A1995RX73800004	J	"Bermejo-Orantes, F.

In the uplands of the Alpujarra, the traditional landscape most at risk is that of the irrigated cultivation terraces. These have often been established centuries ago and rely on water abstracted from streams draining the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The causes of this deintensification include labour shortages, which many Alpujarra municipios reporting population decreases of up to 50 per cent since 1950. Landsat Thematic Mapper digital data from May and August 1992 have been used to identify the various land cover components of the Alpujarra. Ground verification undertaken in September 1992 and April 1993 has confirmed that deintensification of terraced areas around the villages of Trevelez (at 1500 m, the highest village in Spain) and Portugos (1300 m) can be identified as either grassland or matorral. It is recognized that many classes of land cover are mosaics with several elements at a subpixel scale (e.g. terrace risers with fruit trees). However, the output from image processing has allowed areal estimates of the main land covers representing deintensification within the terraced zone. The pattern of deintensification of terraced land is fairly complex. It can be assumed that all terraces were irrigated and cropped at some stage. Land which is no longer cropped is usually grazed and the invasion of matorral species is common, particularly when irrigation ceases. Unirrigated tree crops and vines are sometimes planted on terraces no longer used for cropping. A model of deintensification of farming on terraced land in the Alpujarra is presented.									15	0	0	10	0	15			0898-5812			WOS:A1994QH59900004	J	"Sainz-Cantero, Carmen E.; Alba-Tercedor, Javier; Fresneda, Xavier"				Sainz-Cantero, Carmen Elisa/L-5985-2014				Sobre la distribucion de Agabus (Gaurodytes) solieri Aube, 1836 en la Peninsula Iberica (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae).

I studied the spatial pattern of Cuscuta infestation in H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada, Spain, for 6 years (1988-1993). In addition, I assessed the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage of Cuscuta during 1991. I determined the effect of dodder on H. spinosa reproductive success by comparing the fruit and seed production of both parasitized and non-parasitized host plants, and determining the mortality factors affecting reproductive potential.Cuscuta epithymum was found to parasitize the labelled host plants only in three of the six years of study, and only in two of the three host plant populations. The maximum percentage of infestation ocurred in 1990, in which 20% of the labelled host plants were parasitized by dodders in one population and 15% in the other population. No labelled host plant had more than 35% of its canopy surface covered by dodders. Parasitized plants were visited by fewer pollinators than were non-parasitized plants. In addition, the diversity of the pollinator assemblage also differed between these two groups of plants. The dodder did not significatively affect the fruit or seed production of its host plant, either during the study years or the years following the strong infestation. The dodder causes little harm mainly because it is scarce. However, even the relationship between an individual dodder and an individual host plant is neutral, due to the array of direct and indirect, positive and negative effects appearing between Cuscuta and H. spinosa during the sucessives phases of the reproductive cycle of the host plant.									24	0	0	24	1	25			0030-1299			WOS:A1994PQ83500011	J	"MAYORAL, E; CRESPOBLANC, A; DIAZ, MD; BENOT, C; OROZCO, M"								MIOCENE RIFTING OF THE ALBORAN DOMAIN - DATINGS OF DISCORDANT SEDIMENTS OVER THE ALPUJARRIDE EXTENSIONAL UNITS (SOUTH OF SIERRA-NEVADA, BETIC CHAIN)								COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE II				319	5			581	588					SEP 8 1994	1994	In the Betic Chain, south of Sierra Nevada, two Neogene sedimentary sequences were dated on the basis of planktonic foraminifera associations: marls, which show ages between upper Langhian and upper Serravallian, and the underlying conglomerates, in which intercalated marls include the lower Langhian. These sediments were deposited when the low-angle normal faults of two brittle extensional systems were active. The so-called Contraviesa system, with northward transport direction, is therefore Langhian, and the Filabres system, with southwestward transport, is Serravallian. The faults limit the Alpujarride and Malaguide extensional units and contributed to the rifting of the Alboran Domain.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1251-8069			WOS:A1994PH47800009	J	"GOMEZ, JM; ZAMORA, R"								TOP-DOWN EFFECTS IN A TRITROPHIC SYSTEM - PARASITOIDS ENHANCE PLANT FITNESS								ECOLOGY				75	4			1023	1030		10.2307/1939426			Jun-94	1994	We determined the direct and indirect top-down forces in a tritrophic system composed of a guild of three parasitoid species (Necremnus tidius, N. folia, and Aprostocestus sp.), a single weevil seed-predator species (Ceutorhynchus sp. nov.), and the host plant, Holmathophylla spinosa, a woody crucifer of the high-mountain elevations of the Sierra Nevada (southeast Spain). By means of observational and experimental approaches, we focused on the possible regulatory effects of parasitoids on the weevil population as well as on the analysis of the sign and strength of the resulting indirect effects on plant fitness.Weevils attacked 21.7% of the fruit produced by H. spinosa during the study, selecting fruits having the most seeds. Seeds eaten by weevils were significantly bigger than uneaten ones. The number of seeds per fruit after being depredated by Ceutorhynchus was significantly smaller than for fruit not attacked. Thus, weevils affect the fitness of the host plant both by decreasing the number of seeds (quantitative effect) and by reducing the average size of surviving seeds per fruit (qualitative effect). When parasitoids were excluded experimentally, the percentage of attacked fruit (which corresponds to the number of weevil larvae) rose from 20 to 43%. We assume that the increase in the experimental weevil population may be because excluding parasitoids eliminates not only death by parasitoid oviposition for some Ceutorhynchus larvae, but also death by direct predation of parasitoids on weevil larvae. We have also experimentally verified that parasitoid activity benefits the entire plant, by way of parasitoids contributing to a higher average number of seeds dispersed per fruit in each plant, by influencing both the abundance of the weevils and the behavior of the weevil larvae.									93	1	0	85	0	95			Dec-58			WOS:A1994NP10300015	J	"BEA, F; PEREIRA, MD; CORRETGE, LG; FERSHTATER, GB"				"Bea, Fernando/G-6376-2012; Pereira , Dolores /C-4901-2009"	"Bea, Fernando/0000-0001-6245-2625; "			DIFFERENTIATION OF STRONGLY PERALUMINOUS, PERPHOSPHORUS GRANITES - THE PEDROBERNARDO PLUTON, CENTRAL SPAIN								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				58	12			2609	2627		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90132-5			Jun-94	1994	"The Pedrobemardo pluton (295 +/- 2 Ma; initial Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7122) is a layered, sheet-like granite body with distinct vertical zoning: biotite +/- muscovite-bearing granites in the lower zone, muscovite +/- biotite leucogranites in the middle zone, and muscovite-bearing aplites and pegmatites in the upper zone. The magma was anatectically generated, intruded almost free of restite, and evolved as a closed system by crystallization in situ. Geochemical modelling indicates that the lower and middle zones followed an equilibrium crystallization path, with no separation between solids and melt, and the upper zone followed a fractional crystallization path. Magmatic fractionation produced leucocratic differentiates with high P concentrations and a P/Ca ratio higher than in apatite. The excess P is located in plagioclase and K-feldspar. Monazite (+apatite) fractionation in the lower and middle zones produced extreme depletions in Th, U, Y, and the REEs, and chondrite-normalized REE patterns with low LREEs/HREEs and a slight discontinuity between Nd and Sm. About 90% of the Th, U, Y, and REEs reside in accessory minerals, especially in monazite. Biotite and muscovite have very low REE contents with small positive or no Eu anomalies. K-feldspar and plagioclase in both the lower and upper zones have moderate REE contents with positive Eu anomalies. Feldspars from the upper zone, in contrast, have negative Eu anomalies and have very low REE contents. Compared to available data from literature, D(Sr,Ba,Th,U,Y,REFs)bio/mineral are lower by one to three orders of magnitude, and D(REEs)plag/Kfsp are also lower by one order of magnitude. These huge discrepancies are attributed not only to contamination with REE-rich inclusions in mineral concentrates sed in previous studies, but to real differences in geochemical behavior of trace elements in peraluminous systems, with respect to subaluminous systems. Biotite/melt and, probably, K-feldspar/melt distribution coefficients for Th, U, Y, and the REEs in peraluminous magmas must be much lower than previously considered."									76	3	1	2	0	80			0016-7037			WOS:A1994NT53300003	J	"BAARS, JWM; GREVE, A; HEIN, H; MORRIS, D; PENALVER, J; THUM, C"								DESIGN PARAMETERS AND MEASURED PERFORMANCE OF THE IRAM 30-M MILLIMETER RADIO TELESCOPE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE				82	5			687	696		10.1109/5.284735			May-94	1994	The ''Millimeter Radio Telescope'' (MRT) is operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy in the Millimeter range (IRAM) and is located at 2850-m altitude in the Sierra Nevada, near Granada, Spain. It is a reflector antenna of 30-m diameter with a surface accuracy of 0.08 mm and a pointing accuracy of better than 2 arcsec. The telescope is equipped with sensitive receivers for the atmospheric windows between 0.8- and 7-mm wavelength. We describe the optics layout of the receiver and calibration system, which allows simultaneous observations at a number of frequencies. The special design aspects of the antenna, in particular the control of thermal deformations and the achievement of a high reflector and pointing accuracy are described. We compare the design computations with the characteristics of the telescope, derived from several years of operation and optimization. The success of the design is demonstrated by our observational experience. We conclude the paper with a short review of some of the astronomical results obtained with the telescope.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0018-9219			WOS:A1994NL63900006	J	"RECHE, I; SANCHEZCASTILLO, P; CARRILLO, P"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; "			THE PRINCIPAL REGULATING MECHANISM ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY IN A HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKE								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				130	2			163	178					Apr-94	1994	The changes in the structure of the phytoplankton community in an oligotrophic high mountain lake are analysed, highlighting the effects of nutrient availability, predation by herbivores and fungal parasitism.The phytoplankton community (made up of green algae and chrysophyceae) reached a biovolume-density of 206 . 10(3) mum3 ml-1 at the beginning of the ice-free period, followed by a continual decrease. This community developed in limiting nutrient conditions (mainly P.). The population of green algae suffered a fungal epidemic after the ice melt which lasted approximately three weeks. Oocystis lacustris CHOD, showed a loss rate due to parasitism between 0.002 and 0.42 d-1, which amounts to up to 58 % of the total losses of this population, whereas the losses of Chlorella sp. were unimportant (> 3.5 . 10(-3) d-1).The zooplankton reached a maximum value of biomass (200 mg m-3) at the end of the studied period. The filtration rates oscillated between 0.003 (July) and 0.412 d-1 (September) coinciding with the maximum development of the population of Daphnia pulicaria HRBACEK.									6	0	0	4	0	6			Mar-36			WOS:A1994NM34300003	J	"ESCOS, J; ALADOS, CL; EMLEN, JM"				"Alados, Concepcion/K-8085-2014; Escos, Juan/L-4207-2014"	"Alados, Concepcion/0000-0002-6227-861X; Escos, Juan/0000-0003-2852-2911"			APPLICATION OF THE STAGE-PROJECTION MODEL WITH DENSITY-DEPENDENT FECUNDITY TO THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF SPANISH IBEX								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE				72	4			731	737		10.1139/z94-098			Apr-94	1994	A stage-class population model with density-feedback term included was used to identify the most critical parameters determining the population dynamics of female Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in southern Spain. A population in the Cazorla and Segura mountains is rapidly declining, but the eastern Sierra Nevada population is growing. The stable population density obtained using estimated values of kid and adult survival (0.49 and 0.87, respectively) and with fecundity equal to 0.367 in the absence of density feedback is 12.7 or 16.82 individuals/km(2), based on a non-time-lagged and a time-lagged model, respectively. Given the maximum estimate of fecundity and an adult survival rate of 0.87, a kid survival rate of at least 0.41 is required to avoid extinction. At the minimum fecundity estimate, kid survival would have to exceed 0.52. Elasticities were used to estimate the influence of variation in life-cycle parameters on the intrinsic rate of increase. Adult survival is the most critical parameter, while fecundity and juvenile survival are less important. An increase in adult survival from 0.87 to 0.91 in the Cazorla and Segura mountains population would almost stabilize the population in the absence of stochastic variation, while the same increase in the Sierra Nevada population would yield population growth of 4-5% per annum. A reduction in adult survival to 0.83 results in population decline in both cases.									25	0	0	24	0	25			Aug-01			WOS:A1994PB34900019	J	"CRUZPIZARRO, L; RECHE, I; CARRILLO, P"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			PLANKTON DYNAMICS IN A HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKE (LAS-YEGUAS, SIERRA-NEVADA, SPAIN) - INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF CILIATES AS FOOD SOURCE OF ZOOPLANKTON								HYDROBIOLOGIA				274	01-Mar			29	35		10.1007/BF00014624			FEB 4 1994	1994	A detailed sampling programme during the ice-free season (July-September) in the oligotrophic lake Las Yeguas (Southern Spain) has shown a well-defined time lag between phytoplankton and zooplankton maximum standing stocks, the former displaying a peak (23 mugC l-1) just after the ice-melting, and the latter by the end of September (80 mugC l-1).A ratio of autotrophs to heterotrophs lower than 1 which lasted more than two thirds of the study period may suggest a high algal productivity per unit of biomass. The estimated strong top-down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton indicates an efficient utilization of resources.A comparative analysis between the available food supply and the critical food concentration that is necessary to maintain the population of Daphnia pulicaria (which constitutes up to 98 % of the heterotrophic biomass) proves this species to be food-limited in the lake under study.To explain the dominance (and development) of such large-bodied cladoceran population, we discuss the possibility of the utilization of naked protozoan ciliates (Oligotrichidae) as a complementary high quality food source, and the exploitation of benthic resources through a coupled daily migration behaviour.

The change in lead and zinc concentrations with increasing distance from the road is related to the topography of the area immediately adjacent to the road.

Eighty plants belonging to three populations were permanently labelled during the period 1988-91, and in each plant the duration and date of flowering as well as the estimated flowering synchrony, were noted. The composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage, the abundance of the floral herbivores and the effect of the seed and fruit consumers were also recorded.2 In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the relationship between the flowering synchrony and the three rate-based components of reproductive success (fruit set, brood size and female fertility) were studied. The effect of phenotypic selection on flowering synchrony, as well as on duration and time of flowering, was also studied for these three years, using the method of multiple regression for correlated characters.3 The flowering synchrony of H. spinosa plants ranged from 0.25 to 1.00, although more than 70% of the marked plants had a flowering synchrony level greater than 0.75. The plants with a lower degree of flowering synchrony were visited by a greater number of pollinators and eaten by fewer herbivores.4 However, only in 1989 and 1990 was there a significant relationship between flowering synchrony and brood size of the plants. In addition, the phenological traits did not affect female fertility. The results show that neither directional nor stabilizing/disruptive selection acts on flowering synchrony. For these reasons, I suggest that the flowering synchrony of H. spinosa is not regulated by selective pressure of pollinators or herbivores.									68	2	0	69	3	73			0022-0477			WOS:A1993MP45600001	J	Huemer, Peter								Beitrag zur Kenntnis alpiner Dichrorampha-Arten der Iberischen Halbinsel (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).

The sites represented an altitudinal range from 340 m to 2100 m. The pupal exuviae collections revealed a composite fauna of 143 species. Eukiefferiella (12 spp.) and Tvetenia (3 spp.) were dominant both taxonomically and numerically along most of the altitudinal profile, followed by Cricotopus (11 spp.), Orthocladius (9 spp.) and Diamesa (7 spp.).The altitudinal distribution of the 99 most common species is shown and compared with those obtained in other European streams or rivers, especially in the Pyrenees. The general pattern of altitudinal zonation shows an increase in species richness from the headwaters (< 2000 m : 58 spp.) toward the middle reaches (1000-1600 m : 121 spp.). The theoretically expected highest species richness in the foothill reaches (> 1000 m : 113 spp.) was not obtained. The periods of reduced or intermittent flow, the domestic organic inputs and the narrowness of the channels in the foothill reaches appear responsible for the decrease of the species richness of the chironomid communities.									10	0	0	9	0	10			Mar-88			WOS:000208073800006	J	"BUCHAR, J; THALER, K"								ON THE GENUS ACANTHOLYCOSA IN WESTERN-EUROPE (ARACHNIDA, ARANEIDA, LYCOSIDAE)								REVUE SUISSE DE ZOOLOGIE				100	2			327	341					Jun-93	1993	"Three largely allopatric species of Acantholycosa occurring in the Pyrenees have been redescribed (male female), illustrated and keyed.

This behaviour led us to investigate whether a particular type of rock is selected, and, if so, the advantages to this species of the selection. This study was located at 2400 m above sea-level in the Sierra Nevada mountains (Granada, Spain). To determine the range of rock sizes available, in eight control plots the thicknesses were recorded and also the maximum and minimum diameters of all rocks with surface area of more than 6 cm2. A total of 1724 rocks were recorded, noting among the rock types available those that were used for nesting. Also as a preliminary estimate of the thermal characteristics of the rocks, we recorded the temperatures of the air, soil surface, soil under a rock covering an ant nest, and soil at 30 cm depth. The results indicate that P. longiseta selects flat rocks with a surface area/thickness ratio of 2-5, the thickness being not less than 1.5 cm, the surface area being 50-250 cm2 and volume less than 1000 cm3. This type of rock offers the nests two beneficial but apparently contradictory effects: (1) protection against high temperatures on hot days, and (2) warmth on colder days by absorbing the diffusing solar heat more effectively than the air or soil around the nest.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0020-7128			WOS:A1993LB46200005	J	"ZAMORA, R; GOMEZ, JM"								VERTEBRATE HERBIVORES AS PREDATORS OF INSECT HERBIVORES - AN ASYMMETRICAL INTERACTION MEDIATED BY SIZE DIFFERENCES								OIKOS				66	2			223	228		10.2307/3544808			Mar-93	1993	We have analysed the effect of wild goat (Capra pyrenaica) on the reproductive success of a chalcid gall maker (Systasis encyrtoides), both species being herbivores of Hormathopkylla spinosa, a stunted mediterranean high-mountain shrub. The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector.The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure.									19	0	0	20	0	20			0030-1299			WOS:A1993KJ53500006	J	"ZAMORAMUNOZ, C; SANCHEZORTEGA, A; ALBATERCEDOR, J"				Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/K-7050-2014	Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/0000-0002-3037-1529			PHYSICOCHEMICAL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF MAYFLIES AND STONEFLIES IN A HIGH-MOUNTAIN STREAM IN SOUTHERN EUROPE (SIERRA-NEVADA, SOUTHERN SPAIN)								AQUATIC INSECTS				15	1			11	20		10.1080/01650429309361495			1993	1993	The Rio Monachil, a high-mountain stream in Sierra Nevada (South of Spain), was investigated. As a consequence of sewage discharges from a ski resort situated at the head of the stream and from populations along its banks, the river is affected by organic pollution.With the objective of finding what physico-chemical factors determined the distribution of the Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera along the course of the stream, and in what manner they were affected, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis was applied. Through this analysis it was possible to prove that, in general, the distribution and abundance of these two orders of insects in the Rio Monachil are influenced by organic pollution. Nevertheless, at the species level other factors assume prime importance, such as temperature, oxygenation and mineralization of the waters, parameters which may or may not be related to pollution.									11	0	0	9	3	13			0165-0424			WOS:A1993KQ13000002	J	"Perez-Lopez, F.

We have quantified the abundance and foraging behavior of P. longiseta in comparison with winged flower visitors. We have also examined, by means of selective exclusion experiments, the role of ants as true pollinators, comparing them with the winged flower visitors. A total of 39 species belonging to 18 families visited the flowers of H. spinosa. All the visitors were winged insects, except P. longiseta, a species which alone made up more than 80% of the total number of insects found on the flowers. All pollinators of H. spinosa had similar foraging patterns, with 98% of total movements made between flowers within the same plant. Ants always made contact with the plant reproductive organs when foraging for nectar, and transferred large numbers of pollen grains. However, pollen exposed to ants for brief periods exhibited reduced percentage of germination. P. longiseta is both the most abundant and spatio-temporally predictable flower visitor of H. spinosa. These characteristics, weighted by their flower visitation rate, make worker ants the pollinator that maintains the strongest mutualistic interaction with H. spinosa. The exclusion experiments show that workers behave as true pollinators, since they contribute to increase the number of viable seeds produced by H. spinosa. The key factor of this interaction is mainly the great density of workers throughout the flowering period. In short, the H. spinosa-P. longiseta mutualistic interaction mainly depends on its high probability of occurrence.									70	1	1	72	2	75			0029-8549			WOS:A1992JM22500015	J	"CASAS, JJ; VILCHEZQUERO, A"					Casas Jimenez, Jose Jesus/0000-0003-0928-0080			CRICOTOPUS (CRICOTOPUS) NEVADENSIS SP-N (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) FROM SIERRA-NEVADA (SOUTHERN SPAIN)								HYDROBIOLOGIA				230	2			71	78		10.1007/BF00006127			MAR 6 1992	1992	Male and female imagines, and pupal exuviae of Cricotopus (C.) nevadensis sp. n. are described.

This metamorphic nappe is of great interest to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Betic Chain since two episodes of thrusting inside the same Alpujarride Nappe can be differentiated. These two episodes have been produced in different physical (P. T) conditions and with different directions of thrusting: the first one towards the northeast and the second towards the north-northwest. Furthermore, the plate tectonics reconstructions (Weijermars, 1987; Dewey, 1988) and geodynamic models (Andrieux et al., 1989; Platt and Vissers, 1989) published so far for the Betic Chain have not considered these two episodes of thrusting recognized in all nappes belonging to the Alpujarride Complex of the Betic Chain.In the area studied, to the south of Sierra Nevada, the Adra Nappe shows a marked structural variation, from an upper folded zone consisting of low-grade metamorphic rocks, to a mylonitic zone located in lower levels and characterized by medium to high-grade metamorphic materials. It has been observed that the emplacement of the Adra Nappe has involved two episodes. The first episode produces the formation of mylonitic rocks with a stretching lincation N45-degrees-E. The second one gives rise to gouges and fault breccias, and is bound to movements of the upper block in N10-degrees-W direction. From a regional point of view, in this sector the Adra Nappe occupies the upper tectonic position of the Alpujarride Complex. The extensional regime of the Adra Nappe appears to be intimately associated with the N-S convergence of Africa and Iberia from Oligocene times, whereas the NE-thrusting would reflect a previous strike-slip motion parallel to the trend of the Betic Chain, probably in an oblique convergence setting. These points concerning the two directions of movement must be considered for geological palacoreconstructions of the Western Mediterranean area."									6	0	0	1	0	6			0040-1951			WOS:A1991HB68500014	J	"CARRILLO, P; SANCHEZCASTILLO, P; CRUZPIZARRO, L"				"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			COINCIDENT ZOOPLANKTON AND PHYTOPLANKTON DIEL MIGRATIONS IN A HIGH MOUNTAIN LAKE (LA CALDERA, SIERRA-NEVADA, SPAIN)								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				122	1			57	67					Jul-91	1991	"The high mountain lake, La Caldera, because of its morphometric, physico-chemical and biological characteristics, provides exceptionally favourable conditions to perform research on diel vertical migration patterns, particularly of phytoflagellates.Data from a 24 hour sampling program have revealed zooplankton to show, as a whole, a definite nocturnal migration, comparable to that previously described (CRUZ-PIZARRO, 1978, 1981; CARRILLO et al., 1989).Within the phytoplankton, non-motile and close to neutrally buoyant species (mainly Cyanarcus sp.) showed a limited daily vertical movement remaining, for most of the cycle, at the upper/intermediate layers. These species were used as a reference against which to evaluate the vertical distribution of flagellates which, despite minor specific differences, exhibited a common pattern of migration (exemplified by that of Chromulina nevadensis) involving an evening upward movement and a return downward one after dawn, both roughly coinciding with the highest values of the relative rate of change in light.Zooplankton grazing might account for much of the observed day-night differences in biomass (and density) of motile algal species. Recruitments from narrow but unsampled water layers (such as the neuston) might also contribute to explain the unrealistic computed net growth rates for C. nevadensis in the early morning.Light is probably the stimulus for the algal movement. The possibility of exploiting rich nutrient micropatchiness generated by zooplankton excretion should be able to explain its adaptive value, as other major proposed hypotheses can be discounted in this particular environment."									8	0	0	6	0	8			Mar-36			WOS:A1991GE95000004	J	ZAMORA, R								AVIAN-HABITAT RELATIONSHIPS IN A MEDITERRANEAN HIGH MOUNTAIN								REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE				46	3			231	244					JUL-SEP 1991	1991	The characteristics of the habitats of eight breeding species of birds in the pasture-scrubland of the high-mountain areas of the Sierra Nevada (S. Spain) were studied. Habitat composition and structure were determined by measuring 15 variables in 0.1 ha circular plots within the territories of breeding pairs. The passerines that nest in the high-mountain areas of the Sierra Nevada show different preferences in their choice of habitat. This interspecific segregation appears both with respect to the vertical complexity of the shrub layer (factor I), and to the patchy distribution of habitat components (factor II). Cluster analysis identified two groups of species: those preferring scrubland (Sylvia communis, Emberiza hortulana and Troglodytes troglodytes), and those favouring open ground (mainly Alauda arvensis, Anthus campestris and Oenanthe oenanthe). Emberiza cia shared characteristics common to both groups, while Phoenicurus ochruros bred in rocky terrain. Discriminant function analysis showed the importance of habitat composition (both shrubs and rocks) and structural variables in species segregation. According to these results, I recommend that studies about avian habitat use include quantitative estimates of rocky substrates, especially in high-mountain areas, tundras and deserts.									4	0	1	5	0	6			0249-7395			WOS:A1991FU96000002	J	"CASAS, JJ; VILCHEZQUERO, A"								STEMPELLINELLA-REISSI SP-N (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) FROM SIERRA-NEVADA (SOUTHERN SPAIN)								AQUATIC INSECTS				13	2			115	121		10.1080/01650429109361431			1991	1991	"Stempellinella reissi sp. n. is described from the male imago and pupa.

A rapid cooling stage can be identified from the high nucleation density and high n-values of minerals. A final stage of slow cooling, is identified by a low nucleation density and low n-values. At this stage a residual melt crystallized in thermal equilibrium to the cooling rate of the whole magma chamber. Thermal equilibrium and convection are necessary conditions for mixing. Enclaves can be interpreted as the remaining, non-disaggregated portions of an early injected mafic magma, which in turn underwent hybridization during injection. Their presence indicates the existence of magma mixing proceses and the possibility that the host granitoid was a hybrid rock.									23	3	0	1	0	26			0016-7835			WOS:A1991FQ46900006	J	"ESCOS, J; ALADOS, CL"				"Alados, Concepcion/K-8085-2014; Escos, Juan/L-4207-2014"	"Alados, Concepcion/0000-0002-6227-861X; Escos, Juan/0000-0003-2852-2911"			INFLUENCE OF WEATHER AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF FREE-RANGING SPANISH IBEX IN THE SIERRA-DE-CAZORLA-Y-SEGURA AND IN THE EASTERN SIERRA-NEVADA								MAMMALIA				55	1			67	78		10.1515/mamm.1991.55.1.67			1991	1991	Some parameters are given of the structures of two Spanish ibex populations in the Sierra de Cazorla y Segura and in the eastern Sierra Nevada during the rut (November-December) and post-calving periods from 1982 to 1988. A higher reproductive index, increased juvenil survival, less variable fluctuations in numbers were observed in the eastern Sierra Nevada. This can be correlated with the lower density (2 in km2) compared with the 11 km2 in the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura. This follows the predictions of large-mammal population models, which postulates that density-dependent food limitation occurs at densities near the ecological carrying capacity.In spite of the high adult male mortality usual in most ungulate populations, the sex ratio remained in balance most years in the areas studied. This was probably due to the lower rate of survival found among female young.A significant correlation was found in both the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura and the Sierra Nevada populations between the annual precipitation and kid production and survival of the young (from 6-18 mths), the correlation being closer where population densities were higher (Sierra de Cazorla y Segura population).The negative correlation observed between the spring/summer precipitation and the kid to female ratio during the rut period is probably due to perinatal mortality caused by the weather.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0025-1461			WOS:A1991FP28500006	J	"Cruz-Pizarro, L.; Carrillo, P."

The kleptobiotic interaction could be tested by detailed observations of ants when they searched for food near the plants. I observed a total of 60 ants stealing prey. Ants selectively steal the larger prey, which numerically represents a small fraction of the total prey. Ants also prefer to rob recently captured prey which do not show any signs of damage by the digestion of the plant. To quantify experimentally the rate of prey robbery, I put individuals of Drosophila melanogaster on labelled leaves. Forty seven % of the flies initially placed were robbed in the first 24 h in the site where ants occur. Extraction success depends on the position of the flies on the leaf. The curling movement of the leaves makes the detection and extraction of prey by the ants difficult. The quick extraction of the bigger prey could represent a strong limitation for the plant, as this kleptoparasitic interaction appears during the whole short growth and flowering period of this carnivorous plant.

We find very good agreement between Claret et al. model's (1989) and those from Vanden Berg (1985). However, a systematic effect on the derived masses is found if we use the Hejlesen's results as indicated by previous work by Anderson et al. (1984). The results derived from the evolution models are compared with those derived from pulsation theory. A good agreement is found.					6TH LATIN-AMERICAN REGIONAL CONF ON ASTRONOMY6TH LATIN-AMERICAN REGIONAL CONF ON ASTRONOMY	OCT 16-20, 1989OCT 16-20, 1989	INT ASTRON UNIONINT ASTRON UNION	GRAMADO, BRAZILGRAMADO, BRAZIL	3	0	0	0	0	3			0185-1101			WOS:A1990EM94300086	J	"CARRILLO, P; CRUZPIZARRO, L; SANCHEZCASTILLO, P"				"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			ANALYSIS OF PHYTOPLANKTON-ZOOPLANKTON RELATIONSHIPS IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE UNDER NATURAL AND MANIPULATED CONDITIONS								HYDROBIOLOGIA				200				49	58		10.1007/BF02530328			AUG 27 1990	1990										9	0	0	7	0	10			0018-8158			WOS:A1990EB41500006	J	"CASAS, JJ; LAVILLE, H"								MICROPSECTRA-SEGUYI, A NEW SPECIES OF THE ATTENUATA REISS GROUP (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) FROM SIERRA-NEVADA (SPAIN)								ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE				26	3			421	425					JUL-SEP 1990	1990										3	0	0	4	0	4			0037-9271			WOS:A1990EE69600016	J	"TALAVERA, M; LOPEZLEON, MD; CABRERO, J; CAMACHO, JPM"				"Talavera, Miguel/A-5668-2008; Talavera, Miguel/L-4626-2014; Camacho, Juan Pedro/L-6869-2014; Cabrero, Josefa/L-8899-2014; Lopez-Leon, Maria Dolores/L-9026-2014"	"Talavera, Miguel/0000-0001-7484-6082; Camacho, Juan Pedro/0000-0002-2507-9814; Cabrero, Josefa/0000-0002-5848-6985; Lopez-Leon, Maria Dolores/0000-0003-2337-7313"			MALE GERM LINE POLYSOMY IN THE GRASSHOPPER CHORTHIPPUS-BINOTATUS - EXTRA CHROMOSOMES ARE NOT TRANSMITTED								GENOME				33	3			384	388					Jun-90	1990										8	0	0	9	0	9			0831-2796			WOS:A1990DM75000011	J	"RODRIGUEZ, J; ECHEVARRIA, F; JIMENEZGOMEZ, F"				JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/E-7093-2012	JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0001-8644-7089			PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL SCALINGS OF BODY SIZE IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC, HIGH MOUNTAIN LAKE (LA CALDERA, SIERRA-NEVADA, SPAIN)								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				12	3			593	599		10.1093/plankt/12.3.593			May-90	1990										26	3	0	20	0	29			0142-7873			WOS:A1990DB70400011	J	"ECHEVARRIA, F; CARRILLO, P; JIMENEZ, F; SANCHEZCASTILLO, P; CRUZPIZARRO, L; RODRIGUEZ, J"				"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; "			THE SIZE ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION AND TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION OF PLANKTON IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC, HIGH MOUNTAIN LAKE (LA-CALDERA, SIERRA-NEVADA, SPAIN)								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				12	2			415	422		10.1093/plankt/12.2.415			Mar-90	1990										38	0	0	26	3	38			0142-7873			WOS:A1990CR96300014	J	ZAMORA, R								INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSION BY THE WHEATEAR IN A HIGH-MOUNTAIN PASSERINE COMMUNITY								ORNIS SCANDINAVICA				21	1			57	62		10.2307/3676379			Mar-90	1990										7	0	0	4	0	7			0030-5693			WOS:A1990DD24600008	J	ZAMORA, R								NEST-SITE SELECTION OF THE COMMON WHEATEAR IN HIGH MOUNTAIN AREAS OF SOUTHEASTERN SPAIN								WILSON BULLETIN				102	1			178	180					Mar-90	1990										4	0	0	2	0	4			0043-5643			WOS:A1990CR50200024	J	ZAMOTAJLOV, AS								NEW PALEARCTIC SPECIES OF THE GROUND BEETLES OF THE TRIBE DELTOMERINI (COLEOPTERA, CARABIDAE)								ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL				69	3			133	139					Mar-90	1990										1	0	0	1	0	1			0044-5134			WOS:A1990CY03400017	J	"SANTOS, J; SENTIS, C; ROBLEDO, M; FERNANDEZPIQUERAS, J"				Robledo, Mercedes/O-2230-2013	Robledo, Mercedes/0000-0001-6256-5902			NUCLEOLAR DOMINANCE IN INTERRACIAL HYBRIDS OF THE STEROPLEURUS-MARTORELLI COMPLEX								GENOME				33	1			153	155					Feb-90	1990										1	0	0	1	0	1			0831-2796			WOS:A1990CX65300024	J	ZAMORA R								THE FRUIT DIET OF RING-OUZELS TURDUS-TORQUATUS WINTERING IN THE SIERRA NEVADA SOUTHEAST SPAIN								Alauda				58	1			67	70					1990	1990	A total of 446 droppings of Ring-ouzels (Turdus torquatus) were obtained in October, November, February, and March in the high mountain scrubland of the Sierra Nevada (southeastern Spain). The Ring-ouzel feeds principally on fleshy fruits during autumn and winter. The most widespread and abundant berry is that of the juniper, Juniperus communis, which is also the one most often eaten by the Turdidae. The Ring-ouzel is thus responsible for the wide dispersal of its seeds which, moreover, would also determine plant abundance and distribution in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada.									18	0	0	17	0	20			Feb-19			BIOSIS:PREV199192051054	J	"LEBRETON, P; LARACINEPITTET, C; BAYET, C; LAURANSON, J"								POLYPHENOL VARIABILITY AND SYSTEMATICS OF THE SCOTS PINE (PINUS-SYLVESTRIS L)								ANNALES DES SCIENCES FORESTIERES				47	2			117	130		10.1051/forest:19900203			1990	1990										13	0	0	12	0	14			Mar-12			WOS:A1990DD43900003	J	Zamora, Regino								Seasonal variation of a passerine community in a Mediterranean high-mountain.

On the basis of the space-temporal distribution observed, six basic models of altitudinal distribution as a function of time have been established. Three of these models apply to species with broad requirements capable of supporting both the high temperatures of the lowlands and the cool temperatures of the highlands. The other three models apply to species with narrower requirements incapable of supporting very high and/or low temperatures. Some of them are unable to support the summer period of the mediterranean climate.									1	0	0	1	1	1			0214-1353			BIOSIS:PREV199192062623	J	Wagner, R.

In the second part, he describes the main lithological unities of the province (N-E sector calcareous and mountainous; S-E with the Sierra Nevada siliceous; West with great complexity). The great part of the work is an analysis of the climate. The average temperature shows a N-E sector with great amplitudes, comparatively cool; a S-E region with steep thermical gradients of altitude and a hot west region, with slight amplitude. The maximas of rainfall are in the western region and the N-E. After the study of regional climates, the author analyses the coastal one, and he tries to build an accurate system for the definition of the mediterranean mountain climates."									0	0		0	0	0			0153-8756			BIOSIS:PREV199191014539	B	"BASTAZO G; VELA J M; AVILA J M"								CHRYSOMELIDAE COLEOPTERA OF SIERRA NEVADA SOUTHERN SPAIN								EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF COLEOPTEROLOGY.

Their distribution during the year is very different: few species are present during all the year. Each season, or even each short seasonal period has its own faune. Typically explosive species appear between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They are progressively present at different altitudes in all excrements and generally with high number of specimens. The greatest abundance at the different hours of the day is in relation with the activity of different species.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0392-758X			BIOSIS:PREV199089046783	J	"Perez Raya, F.; Casares Porcel, M.; Jimenez Gonzalez, J."

The recent inclusion of Nupedia in Pegoplata is accepted, but it is pointed out that Pegoplata s. lat. is probably paraphyletic in terms of Myopina. The monophyly of Pegoplata (section cuticornis) is confirmed, and it is argued that its sister group is section acutipennis.

The relationships between different species of dung beetles and different ecological parameters (topographic, temporal and biological factors) were analyzed. The phenology and space distribution is discussed in the most abundant species. On the other hand, general models of fenology of these beetles are presented. Possible causes of the high altitudinal distribution abserved in Sierra Nevada mountains are discussed.									2	0		2	0	2			0013-9440			BIOSIS:PREV198987104647	J	"HINZ W; KUIPER J G J; BIEDERMANN W"								ON THE FAUNA OF PISIDIUM-SPP AND OTHER FRESHWATER MOLLUSCS IN THE PROVINCE OF GRANADA SOUTH SPAIN								Malakologische Abhandlungen (Dresden)				13	Sep-17			119	136					1988	1988	In the province of Granada, Spain, 300,000 molluscs were collected in 81 out of 86 explored localities. The bivalves exclusively belong to the genus Pisidium viz. casertanum and personatum, both very common, as well as a few specimens of subtruncatum, milium and nitidum, the latter two only in the swamps south of Padul. The earlier reported (ALONSO, 1975) occurrence of hibernicum, obtusale, pseudosphaerium and tenuilineatum is obviously due to incorrect identifications. Until evidence is available, these four species have to be struck off from the faunal list of Granada. The snails belong to 20 taxa. At most 10 species of molluscs have been found living in association. In waters of about 3,000 m above sea level only P. casertanum occurs. A slightly elongated form of this species lives in the system of the Rio Cacin, a striated one in the brooks of the eastern Sierra Nevada.									1	0		1	0	1			0070-7260			BIOSIS:PREV198987027780	J	JIMENEZ-GUIRADO D								SPECIES OF DORYLAIMUS DUJARDIN 1845 NEMATODA FROM SOUTHERN SPAIN								Miscellania Zoologica (Barcelona)				12				33	40					1988	1988	Since 1972 a large number of freshwater samples was collected in the basin of the River Guadalquivir (Southern Spain) from the marshes in the estuary to the high mountains of Sierra Nevada.

Three types of plants were identified: (i) diploid plants (2n = 18, 26%); (ii) diploid plants with a variable number of B chromosomes (1-8 B's, 40%); and (iii) polysomic plants (2n = 19-23) with or without B's (34%). B's are of two types: metacentric and acrocentric and are associated with three types of abnormalities: (i) failure of the A chromosomes to move to the poles at anaphase I; (ii) nondisjunction of some A chromosomes at anaphase II; and (iii) the occurrence of tetraploid sporocytes. The B's are isopycnotic, do not associate with the A's, and invariably occur as univalents at first meiosis but show no tendency for elimination. All members of the complement except the satellite chromosome, no. 6, have been detected in a trisomic or a tetrasomic condition. Additionally some unusual structural variants, not present in the diploid standard complement, appear in some polysomic individuals. The polysomic elements are euchromatic, stable, and they do not associate either with normal chromosomes or with B's. The polysomic elements form univalents when they are trisomic and bivalents when tetrasomic. The fact that a high frequency (94%) of the polysomic elements also carry B's suggests that these two forms of numerical variation are interrelated in origin."									0	0		0	0	0			0831-2796			BIOSIS:PREV198784025137	J	Morales Baquero, R.

The morphology and development of these soils are due to the action of the climate of high mountain with big stational contrast, a vegetation which is typical of the edges of river with some nitrate accumulator species and the parent material, micaschist. The accumulation and the degree of humifidication of organic matter is related with the contribution of high amounts of roots and other plant residues as were on the action and quantities of worms. The hydromorphy of these soils is reduced to the presence of red mottled of iron near of the stones and gravel. The soil type gley evolve in a reductor regimen of moisture which is not present in our soils because of the water in the voids of these soils is not a stagnant water but a water which circulates and whose contribution is linked to the thaw of the snow of Sierra Nevada and so is a water that contains O2. The hydromorphologic process are indicated by their low chromas and red mottles, due to the characteristics and weathering of the original material. The creation of a new subgroupat the F.A.O.

The soil have been classified as dystric Xerochrept, typic Xerumbrepts and typic Xerorthent. In most cases the soil has a profile with O, Ah and Bw horizons. The development degree of the last horizon is function of the landscape position. Textures are sandy loam skeletal. They have an acid reaction, a little base saturation and a little sesquioxides mobilization process. The humic profile is conditioned by a relatively high content organic matter, and humus type near moder. The main pedogenetic processes are in order of importance, melanization, alteration-brunification and chemistry podzolization (the last is a little evident).									0	0		0	0	0			0365-1797			BIOSIS:PREV198783029166	J	"RUIZ REJON C; RUIZ REJON M"								CHROMOSOMAL POLYMORPHISM FOR A HETEROCHROMATIC SUPERNUMERARY SEGMENT IN A NATURAL POPULATION OF TULIPA-AUSTRALIS LILIACEAE								Canadian Journal of Genetics and Cytology				27	6			633	638					1985	1985	Five hundred bulbs of Tulipa australis Link, and where possible the associated young flowers, have been analyzed cytogenetically in four natural populations collected from the Sierra Nevada of Spain. A majority of these were diploid (2n = 24), but a few triploids (3n = 36) were present in the population from the highest altitude. All the diploid plants from three of these populations were basic homozygotes with homomorphic bivalents. In one population, however, three types of plants were identified: homozygous standard plants (80%), plants heterozygous for a large supernumerary chromosome segment (19%), and plants homozygous for its same segment (1%). The segment was located terminally on the short arm of a submetacentric chromosome. It was heteropycnotic at meiotic prophase, showed dark C-banding at metaphase I, and was visible as a prominent heterochromatic chromocentre at interphase. The segment divided reductionally in a majority of anaphase I cells (88%), which means that chiasmata tend to be excluded from the arm carrying the segment. Seeds obtained from plants homozygous for the extra segment always carried one such segment. One-half of the seedlings of heterozygous plants are themselves heterozygous for the extra segment, while the other half lack the segment. Finally, 11% of the seeds from bulbs without a segment turned out to be segment heterozygotes. From these results, it is deduced that the extra segment is sexually transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and that it has little or no effect on male fertility and fecundity.									0	0		0	0	0			Aug-93			BIOSIS:PREV198681092149	J	VALLE F								MAP OF THE VEGETATION SERIES OF THE SIERRA-NEVADA MOUNTAINS SPAIN								Ecologia Mediterranea				11	02-Mar			183	200					1985	1985										3	0		3	0	3			0153-8756			BIOSIS:PREV198630081209	J	Gusenleitner, J.

In a collection of 227 plants from all parts of the distribution area of the species, the chromosome numbers 2n = 34, 51, 68, 102 and 136 were found. In S. album the morphological variation is not correlated with the differences in chromosome numbers. On the contrary, a more or less continuous morphological series occurs in this species within which a number of geographical races can be distinguished. The very small plants from Gotland (Sweden) are an extreme of this series. In the Baltic region plants with pale green leaves and yellow anthers occur which differ from the typical form in that they do not synthesize cyanidin. They have been described as var. pallens Hartm. and are classified here as forma pallens. Of all European Sedum species S. gypsicolum Boiss. et Reuter is the one which resembles S. album most closely and it also has the basic chromosome number X = 17. In 6 plants from the sierra Nevada (Spain) the chromosome numbers 2n = 68 and 102 were found. Since S. album and S. gypsicolum differ in a number of morphological characters and since a polyploid series occurs within both taxa they should be regarded as distinct species.									0	0		0	0	0			0023-3374			BIOSIS:PREV198376023939	J	TERCEDOR J A								EPHEMERELLA-IKONOMOVI-NEVADENSIS NEW-SUBSPECIES OF SIERRA-NEVADA SPAIN EPHEMEROPTERA EPHEMERELLIDAE								Boletin de la Asociacion Espanola de Entomologia				6				285	294					1982	1982	The nymph of E.

Quartzites and micaschists are the most widespread rocks. The oldest geomorphic surfaces (slopes < 20.degree.) are occupied by Entic Cryumbrepts, while in the younger ones (slopes over 20.degree.) Lithic Cryorthents are the dominant soils. Differences in profile development for the Cryumbrepts depend mainly on slight differences in relief.									0	0		0	0	0			0365-1797			BIOSIS:PREV198171063208	J	"DELGADO CALVO-FLORES R; HUERTAS F; LINARES J"								THE SOILS OF THE BARRANCO-HONDO SPAIN 2. GEOCHEMICAL STUDY								Anales de Edafologia y Agrobiologia				38	09-Oct			1555	1572					1979	1979	The reactions of chemical weathering were identified and quantified in a small watershed of Sierra Nevada. The A horizon shows mineralogical variations with respect to the parent rock. In the other horizons the primary minerals are distributed among the different fractions: quartz and albite in the coarse sizes, while phyllosilicates are concentrated in the fine fractions. Natural weathering on an annual basis produces 6042 kg of albite, 739 kg of muscovite, 3649 kg of hornblende, 12,279 kg of dolomite and 8905 kg of calcite. The mean age of the soils, calculated from the loss of albite, is 4429 .+-. 980 yr.									0	0		0	0	0			0365-1797			BIOSIS:PREV198171063209	J	Tinaut Ranera, J.A.

The 1st, corresponding to the nominate subspecies, occupies the north, the center and the east of the Iberian Peninsula [Spain, Portugal], and extends southwards as far as the Sierra Nevada [Spain]. The 2nd subspecies V. l. gaditana is characterized by a smaller number of ventral scales (130.88 .+-. 4.41 instead of 141.31 .+-. 3.46) and is widely distributed in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, the Rif, the Middle Atlas [northern Africa] and the Algerian Tell. Although individuals from the Algerian Tell belong to the southern group, the intrapopulation variability of the samples from Alger and Annaba (Bone) is greater than that between samples from either Morocco or the southwest Iberian Peninsula, posing a taxonomic problem which cannot be resolved here due to the smallness of the sample size.									0	0		0	0	0			0035-418X			BIOSIS:PREV197865044644	J	"SURINACH, E; UDIAS, A"								DETERMINATION OF ROOT UNDER SIERRA-NEVADA (SPAIN) BY NUMERICAL INVERSION OF SEISMIC DATA								TRANSACTIONS-AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION				58	9			911	911					1977	1977										0	0	0	0	0	0			Feb-06			WOS:A1977DS72800204	J	GERVAIS C								HYBRIDIZATION TESTS IN PERENNIAL SPANISH OATS GENUS HELICTOTRICHON FROM THE HELICTOTRICHON-FILIFOLIUM HELICTOTRICHON-SARRACENORUM COMPLEX								Bulletin de la Societe Neuchateloise des Sciences Naturelles				100				137	142					1977	1977	"The hybridization of 2 spp. of Helictotrichon from southeast Spain, belonging to the H. sarracenorum-H. filifolium complex is reported.
