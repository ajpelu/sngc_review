The rhizosphere bacterial community associated with wild thyme, Thymus zygis L., plants was analyzed using cultivation, the creation of a near-full length 16S rRNA gene clone library and 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. The bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (mostly Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Although each approach gave a different perspective of the bacterial community, all classes/subclasses detected in the clone library and the cultured bacteria could be found in the pyrosequencing datasets. However, an exception caused by inconclusive taxonomic identification as a consequence of the short read length of pyrotags together with the detection of singleton sequences which corresponded to bacterial strains cultivated from the same sample highlight limitations and considerations which should be taken into account when analysing and interpreting amplicon datasets. Amplicon pyrosequencing of replicate rhizosphere soil samples taken a year later permit the definition of the core microbiome associated with Thymus zygis plants. Abundant bacterial families and predicted functional profiles of the core microbiome suggest that themain drivers of the bacterial community in the Thymus zygis rhizosphere are related to the nutrients originating from the plant root and to their participation in biogeochemical cycles thereby creating an intricate relationship with this aromatic plant to allow for a feedback ecological benefit.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000367810600055	26741495J	"Jesus Perez-Luque, Antonio; Miguel Barea-Azcon, Jose; Alvarez-Ruiz, Lola; Javier Bonet-Garcia, Francisco; Zamora, Regino"								Dataset of Passerine bird communities in a Mediterranean high mountain (Sierra Nevada, Spain)								ZOOKEYS					552			137	154		10.3897/zookeys.552.6934			2016	2016	In this data paper, a dataset of passerine bird communities is described in Sierra Nevada, a Mediterranean high mountain located in southern Spain. The dataset includes occurrence data from bird surveys conducted in four representative ecosystem types of Sierra Nevada from 2008 to 2015. For each visit, bird species numbers as well as distance to the transect line were recorded. A total of 27847 occurrence records were compiled with accompanying measurements on distance to the transect and animal counts. All records are of species in the order Passeriformes. Records of 16 different families and 44 genera were collected. Some of the taxa in the dataset are included in the European Red List. This dataset belongs to the Sierra Nevada Global-Change Observatory (OBSNEV), a long-term research project designed to compile socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types in order to identify the impacts of global change in this area.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1313-2989	1313-2970		WOS:000368394100009	J	"Fernandez Prieto, Jose Antonio; Molero Mesa, Joaquin; Perez Suarez, Marta; Sanna, Mauro; Munoz Diaz, Jose Miguel; Cires, Eduardo"								Are they different species or vicariant elevational races of the same species?

These populations are being experimentally cultivated in the same field since 2008. We studied their biomass and essential oil production (Clevenger hydrodistillation, HD and semi-industrial vapor-pressure, VP). The domesticated population showed lower chemical variation and higher biomass and essential oil yields, allowing for the registration of a new plant variety. The observed variations in oil composition (HD, VP) between the two populations were mostly quantitative. The oils were characterized by the presence of cis-epoxyocimene, ()-cis-chrysanthenol, chrysanthenyl acetate, linalool and trans-caryophyllene. The insect antifeedant (Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Spodoptera littoralis, Myzus persicae and Rhopalosiphum padi) and antifungal (Fusarium spp. and Botrytis cinerea) effects of their oils were also tested. All VP extracts showed strong antifungal effects and the active antifungal compounds have been identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, it was analysed for fossil pigments and their derivatives and the geochemical (C/N ratio, grain-size analyses and isotopic dating) and climatic (temperature and rainfall values obtained from a long instrumental series) variables. The main pigments were carotenoids that indicate cyanobacteria (zeaxanthin, echinenone and myxoxanthophyll), diatoms and chrysophytes (fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin) and green algae (lutein). The changes in pigment abundance over time were mainly explained by the temperature. Zeaxanthin showed a marked decrease from the 19th century to the present and is attributed to picoplanktonic cyanobacteria in Rio Seco Lake. This decrease may result from climate-driven factors affecting herbivorous grazing pressure and water residence time. The increasing human activity around the lake likely generated a high input of carotenoid-poor pigmented organic matter and led to the dilution of chlorophylls and labile carotenoids observed over recent decades.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0213-8409	1989-1806		WOS:000366881500014	J	"Palenzuela, J.

It is based on digital elevation model of differences (DEMoD) among high-resolution digital models (HRDEM) produced from light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Because these qualitative approaches based on HRDEMs can be affected by errors related to misalignment between different passes of the airborne sensor and errors in classifying points, a simplified strategy was undertaken for their semi-automatic correction and supervision for analyzing geomorphological changes. Besides, it became possible to detect, delineate, and classify a total of 47 natural landslides and 50 slope-cut failures over an area of 234 km(2) on the basis of the analysis of the LiDAR products (DEMs and DEMoD) and the orthophotography imagery inspection integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). Most of the displacements detected were probably generated during the winter of 2009-2010 when a new record of cumulative rainfall was reached. The displacement rate of these movements cannot be known with precision, but the minimum velocity that can be obtained is 0.3 m/year regarding the period between the two data acquisitions carried out in November 2008 and July 2010. On the other hand, a comparison was made of the existing susceptibility maps with respect to this new inventory, which indicated greater landslide frequency in areas of moderate susceptibility levels. The influence of treating inventories at different temporal scales is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1612-510X	1612-5118		WOS:000366124000001	J	"Nassl, Michael; Loeffler, Joerg"								Ecosystem services in coupled social-ecological systems: Closing the cycle of service provision and societal feedback								AMBIO				44	8			737	749		10.1007/s13280-015-0651-y			Dec-15	2015	Both the 'cascade model' of ecosystem service provision and the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework individually contribute to the understanding of human-nature interactions in social-ecological systems (SES). Yet, as several points of criticism show, they are limited analytical tools when it comes to reproducing complex cause-effect relationships in such systems. However, in this paper, we point out that by merging the two models, they can mutually enhance their comprehensiveness and overcome their individual conceptual deficits. Therefore we closed a cycle of ecosystem service provision and societal feedback by rethinking and reassembling the core elements of both models. That way, we established a causal sequence apt to describe the causes of change to SES, their effects and their consequences. Finally, to illustrate its functioning we exemplified and discussed our approach based on a case study conducted in the Alpujarra de la Sierra in southern Spain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-7447	1654-7209		WOS:000365268600003	25964160J	"Gilgado, Jose D.; Enghoff, Henrik; Tinaut, Alberto; Mauries, Jean-Paul; Ortuno, Vicente M."

TECTONOPHYSICS				663		SI		19	32		10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.015			NOV 16 2015	2015	We have performed a geomorphic analysis of the Sierra Nevada, the highest range of the Betic Cordillera (SE Spain), with the aim to elucidate its late Miocene to present-day exhumation history. The qualitative and quantitative analysis is based on filtered topography, local relief, swath-profile analysis, anomalies on stream orientation, bulk erosion volume, hypsometry, and steepness index (k(sn)). All these parameters are intimately linked to river incision and development of drainage pattern, having been calculated to assess the role of folding and faulting on the evolution of the Sierra Nevada. Moreover, uplift rates in the core of the Sierra Nevada have been deduced from an extrapolation of the position of Late Tortonian to Pliocene coastline deposits. These data have been compared to apatite (U-Th)/He, fission-track and Be-10 cosmogenic data from SE Spain in order to evaluate the consistency among uplift, thermal histories and denudation rates. Our preferred tectonic scenario is one that favors fast exhumation of the western Sierra Nevada in a NW SE overall compressive setting produced by the convergence between the Nubia and Africa plates. Sub-perpendicular to this compression, a westward 4 mm/year extensional hanging-wall displacement promotes uplift and unroofing of the western part of Sierra Nevada. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

New CGPS data from the central and eastern Betic Cordillera and its foreland-obtained mainly from the Topo-Iberia project allowed us to precisely determine the rate of tectonic deformation. Most of the displacements of the central and eastern Betics are westward, with a variable southwestward component, in relation to the Eurasian stable plate. While in the Iberian foreland the displacements are extremely low, some deformation related to low compressional deformation occurs in the easternmost foreland basin and eastern Betic Cordillera. The displacement increases substantially southwards and westwards in relation to present-day extensional deformation. Major active discontinuities correspond to the NW-SE normal fault zones, which dip westwards; they are located in Almeria-Tabernas; Balanegra, and western Sierra de Gador; whereas the Padul fault zone located west of Sierra Nevada extends northwards to the Granada Basin. NW-SE extensional faults are also observed to the north, in the Baza Basin. Moreover, the activity of dextral faults along the Sorbas-Tabernas-Alpujarras-Guajares band, generally considered as a transfer fault zone, is evidenced by the displacement data. These results come to demonstrate the low activity or inactivity of the large northern E-W oriented folds of the central and eastern Internal Zone, such as the Sierra de Los Filabres antiform. They also point to the possible residual activity of the northern part of the NE-SW Sierra Nevada antiform, where the maximum relief of the Cordillera is found. Altogether, our data support a heterogeneous present-day westward extension that affects the upper crust of the Betic Cordillera and increases towards the thinned continental crust of the Alboran Sea and towards the west, which is compatible with roll-back subduction along the Gibraltar Arc.

In this work, we analyse the capacity of three pine species, namely cluster (Pinus pinaster), black (Pinus nigra) and Scots (Pinus sylvestris) pine, naturally set along an altitudinal gradient (1350-2000 m a.s.l. in SE Spain), to produce an induced defence against defoliation by an expanding pest, the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). Pines were subjected to experimental defoliation, and the tree response was analysed by means of chemical analysis and bioassays with first-instar larvae of T. pityocampa. None of the pine species showed a notable change in chemistry after experimental defoliation, suggesting that chemical defences in pines represent constitutive rather than inducible defences. However, constitutive defences do not deter T. pityocampa, and larval survival did not vary depending of the previous damage suffered by trees. These results indicate that the three pine species analysed have a low capacity to respond after T. pityocampa attack, and thus a limited induced response against the herbivory caused by this specialist insect.

The Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) is a sexually dimorphic mountain ungulate endemic to the Iberian Peninsula commonly affected by sarcoptic mange, a chronic catabolic skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. Since 1992, sarcoptic mange affects the Iberian ibex population of the Sierra Nevada Natural Space (SNNS). This study aims at exploring whether mange severity, in terms of prevalence and its effects on body condition, is male-biased in Iberian ibex.Findings: One thousand and seventy-one adult Iberian ibexes (439 females and 632 males) were randomly shot-harvested in the SNNS from May 1995 to February 2008. Sarcoptic mange stage was classified as healthy, mildly infected or severely infected. Sex-biased prevalence of severe mange was evaluated by a Chi-square test whereas the interaction between mange severity and sex on body condition was assessed by additive models. Among scabietic individuals, the prevalence of severely affected males was 1.29 times higher than in females. On the other hand, both sexes were not able to take profit of a higher availability of seasonal food resources when sarcoptic, particularly in the severe stages.Conclusions: Sarcoptic mange severity is male-biased in Iberian ibex, though not mange effects on body condition. Behavioural, immunological and physiological characteristics of males may contribute to this partial sex-biased susceptibility to sarcoptic mange.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1756-3305			WOS:000364443100001	26555065J	"Carvalho, Joao; Granados, Jose E.; Lopez-Olvera, Jorge R.; Javier Cano-Manuel, Francisco; Perez, Jesus M.; Fandos, Paulino; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Velarde, Roser; Fonseca, Carlos; Raez, Arian; Espinosa, Jose; Pettorelli, Nathalie; Serrano, Emmanuel"				Fandos, Paulino/M-7304-2015	Fandos, Paulino/0000-0002-9607-8931			Sarcoptic mange breaks up bottom-up regulation of body condition in a large herbivore population								PARASITES & VECTORS				8						572	10.1186/s13071-015-1188-4			NOV 6 2015	2015	"Background: Both parasitic load and resource availability can impact individual fitness, yet little is known about the interplay between these parameters in shaping body condition, a key determinant of fitness in wild mammals inhabiting seasonal environments.Methods: Using partial least square regressions (PLSR), we explored how temporal variation in climatic conditions, vegetation dynamics and sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) severity impacted body condition of 473 Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) harvested between 1995 and 2008 in the highly seasonal Alpine ecosystem of Sierra Nevada Natural Space (SNNS), southern Spain.Results: Bottom-up regulation was found to only occur in healthy ibexes; the condition of infected ibexes was independent of primary productivity and snow cover.

Vegetation and climate changes during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene in SW Anatolia, Turkey								QUATERNARY RESEARCH				84	3			448	456					Nov-15	2015	Pollen analysis was done on lacustrine sedimentary sequences dated by micromammals as late Pliocene-early Pleistocene that outcrop in two Neogene graben basins from SW Turkey. This study shows vegetation changes from steppe-like to more forested environments, very similar to the cyclic oscillations related to late Pleistocene glacial-interglacial climate changes. Artemisia was abundant during cold-arid periods, indicating that this species was already widespread in this area during the latest Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. A review of pollen records from Anatolia agrees with this study, suggesting that the spreading of this arid species occurred during a major climatic change: the beginning of the first glaciations and probably a change in seasonality towards summer aridity. Artemisia temporarily disappeared from the region during warm-wet periods and thus we suggest that glacial-interglacial-type oscillations already occurred in the area during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene.

Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9.3 and 2.9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density can be used as a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 53 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and a return to year-round aridity in southwestern Europe.

Does tail autotomy affect thermoregulation in an accurately thermoregulating lizard? Lessons from a 2200-m elevational gradient								JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				297	3			204	210		10.1111/jzo.12266			Nov-15	2015	Tail autotomy is an antipredatory defense that allows lizards to escape predator attacks by shedding their tails. While the benefits of preserving life are indisputable, tail loss implies a number of physiological, social, reproductive and even metabolic costs derived from tail regeneration and reduced motility. In addition, predation risk is increased in lizards with autotomized tails. Metabolic rates increase with body temperature, which in ectotherms depends on external heat sources. Ectotherm thermoregulation is costly in terms of time consumption and exposure to predators, this cost depending on habitat thermal quality. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effects of tail autotomy on field and selected body temperature of an accurately thermoregulating lizard Psammodromus algirus in different thermal environments along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. According to a physiological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to show higher body temperatures that allow them to regenerate lost tissues faster, at least when the thermal environment is not limiting (at mid and low elevations). By contrast, according to an ethological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to avoid exposure to predators by reducing thermoregulation time, thus showing lower temperatures than lizards with non-autotomized tails. However, we found that the tail state did not significantly affect lizard field or selected body temperatures. On the one hand, a warmer thermal optimum could imply greater exposure to predators during basking, making motility-impaired lizards with autotomized tails more vulnerable, which could explain why the physiological hypothesis of autotomy thermal effect does not apply. On the other hand, lower body temperatures could be physiologically costly for lizards, which, together with the other costs resulting from tail autotomy, could jeopardize lizard fitness. Therefore, both hypotheses were not supported.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000364643900005	J	"Leverkus, Alexandro B.; Castro, Jorge; Delgado-Capel, Manuel J.; Molinas-Gonzalez, Carlos; Pulgar, Manuel; Maranon-Jimenez, Sara; Delgado-Huertas, Antonio; Querejeta, Jose I."

We evaluated the performance of planted seedlings of two oak species at two sites in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain): one located within the current altitudinal forest range (1,600-1,760 m), and one above the upper forest limit (1,970-2,120 m). The forest service planted 1,350 seedlings of the deciduous Pyrenean oak and the evergreen Holm oak in a postfire successional shrubland. After 2 years, seedlings were monitored for survival, and a subset of 110 Pyrenean oaks and 185 Holm oaks were harvested for analyses of biomass and foliar nutrient status, C-13, and O-18. Both species showed the highest survival and leaf N status above the upper forest limit, and survival increased with altitude within each plot. The deciduous oak benefited most from planting at higher altitude, and it also had greater biomass at the higher site. Correlations between foliar N, O-18, and C-13 across elevations indicate tighter stomatal control of water loss and greater water-use efficiency with increasing plant N status at higher altitude, which may represent a so-far overlooked positive feedback mechanism that could foster uphill range shifts in water-limited mountain regions. Given ongoing trends and future projections of increasing temperature and aridity throughout the Mediterranean region, tree-species selection for forest restoration should target forecasted climatic conditions rather than those prevailing in the past. This study highlights that ecosystem restoration provides an opportunity to assist species range shifts under rapidly changing climate.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1061-2971	1526-100X		WOS:000363671300024	J	"Raez-Bravo, Arian; Enrique Granados, Jose; Joaquin Ceron, Jose; Javier Cano-Manuel, Francisco; Fandos, Paulino; Maria Perez, Jesus; Espinosa, Jose; Casimiro Soriguer, Ramon; Ramon Lopez-Olvera, Jorge"				Fandos, Paulino/M-7304-2015	Fandos, Paulino/0000-0002-9607-8931			Acute phase proteins increase with sarcoptic mange status and severity in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica, Schinz 1838)								PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH				114	11			4005	4010		10.1007/s00436-015-4628-3			Nov-15	2015	Sarcoptic mange is a contagious skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, affecting both domestic and wild mammals, including the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), a medium-sized mountain ungulate almost endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. Acute phase proteins (APPs) could be an indicator of sarcoptic mange disease and severity in Iberian ibex. Serum samples from 131 healthy and sarcoptic mange-affected Iberian ibexes were collected from 2005 to 2012 in Sierra Nevada Natural Space in southern Spain. Serum alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) concentrations were quantified, and statistically significant differences according to sarcoptic mange disease and severity were assessed. Both AGP and SAA were significantly higher in the sarcoptic mange-affected ibexes than in the healthy ones as well as in the severely affected ibexes as compared to those with less than 50 % of the body surface affected. For the first time, changes in APP are reported in relation to sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex. It is also reported for the first time that the intensity of APP increase depends on the severity of sarcoptic mange, which could be related with the pathological secondary amyloidosis, leading to organ dysfunction in severely mange-affected animals. Species and population differences in the increase of APP in response to sarcoptic mange could indicate individual and population differences in the immune capability of each population to deal with mange, population prevalence and mortality being the last indicators of such sensitivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000361730100007	26227139J	"Azor, Jairo S.; Santos, Xavier; Pleguezuelos, Juan M."

In the Mediterranean Basin, planting pines has been a widespread practice that has transformed and degraded natural habitats. Understanding the response of living organisms to these anthropogenic disturbances and their management is essential for the conservation of biodiversity. Reforestation in Spain until the end of the 20th century was conducted primarily with Pinus species at unnaturally high densities. We have analyzed the response of a reptile community to thinning management in pine plantations within the Sierra Nevada National Park (SE Spain). Surveyed plots covered a gradient of tree densities (according treatments) from unlogged plots, 50% logged trees, 66% logged trees, and surrounding areas of open landscape with sparse trees. Four replicates (plots) were considered per treatment, with 4 visits per plot. In each plot, we measured three reptile community metrics, species richness, abundance, and Pielou's evenness. We hypothesize that reptile metrics will increase with the reduction of pine density and canopy, and an increase of solar radiation. Our results showed a negligible response after a 50% thinning, but a significant response of the reptile community after a 66% reduction. This study demonstrates that intense logging in pine plantations restores reptile diversity in the Mediterranean Basin. This is intended to serve as a model for forest management to restore biodiversity in this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present a multiwavelength study of the Be/X-ray binary system XTE J1946+274 with the main goal of better characterizing its behavior during X-ray quiescence. We also aim to shed light on the possible mechanisms which trigger the X-ray activity for this source.Methods. XTE J1946+274 was observed by Chandra-ACIS during quiescence in 2013 March 12. In addition, this source has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife, Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) since 2011 September, and from the TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2005 April. We have performed spectral and photometric temporal analyses in order to investigate the quiescent state and transient behavior of this binary system.Results. Our optical study revealed that a long mass ejection event from the Be star took place in 2006, lasting for about seven years, and another one is currently ongoing. We also found that a large Be circumstellar disk is present during quiescence, although major X-ray activity is not observed. We made an attempt to explain this by assuming the permanently presence of a tilted (sometimes warped) Be decretion disk. The 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum of the neutron star during quiescence was well fitted with either an absorbed black-body or an absorbed power-law models. The main parameters obtained for these models were kT = 1.43 +/- 0.17 and Gamma = 0.9 +/- 0.4 (with N-H similar to 2-7 x 10(22) cm(-2)). The 0.3-10 keV flux of the source was similar to 0.8-1 x 10(-12) erg(-1) cm(-2) s(-1). Pulsations were found with P-pulse = 15.757(1) s (epoch MJD 56 363.115) and an rms pulse fraction of 32.1(3)%. The observed X-ray luminosity during quiescent periods was close to that of expected in supersonic propeller regimen.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-0746			WOS:000363538500053	J	"Leverkus, Alexandro B.; Rojo, Manuel; Castro, Jorge"				Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014	Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240			Habitat complexity and individual acorn protectors enhance the post-fire restoration of oak forests via seed sowing								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				83				276	280		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.06.033			Oct-15	2015	Oak reforestation via direct sowing has advantages over planting for economic and plant-morphological reasons, but the risk of high acorn predation usually dissuades land managers from using this method. In a previous study we hypothesised that overcoming acorn predation would require both large-scale solutions to reduce predation by large mammals - which we had effectively obtained through ecosystem management leading to greater habitat complexity - and small-scale protection to tackle predation by small mammals - which we had been unsuccessful to encounter. In this study we aimed to test this hypothesis under the same management areas but with a new acorn-scale protective device named seed shelter. We carried out an acorn predation experiment in Sierra Nevada (S Spain), in a burnt area with three replicates of each of two post-fire management treatments: non-intervention (NI), with high habitat complexity due to the abundance of lying burnt trees, and salvage logging (SL), with low habitat complexity due to the previous felling and piling of the tree trunks and chopping of the branches. In each replicate we sowed 50 acorns with seed shelter and 50 acorns without (N = 600 acorns). After 129 days, predation by rodents averaged 17% for control acorns, while the seed shelter reduced this to nil. Predation by boars (17.5% overall) was not affected by the seed shelter but was reduced to one-sixth in the NI treatment (5% vs 30% in SL), so we obtained the lowest overall predation rates in the combined NI + seed shelter treatment (5%). We thus corroborated our hypothesis that combining large-scale management with an acorn-scale protection can greatly increase the success of sowing. We expect these outcomes to increase the effectiveness of direct sowing and to raise the share of this practice in reforestation, especially for species that develop best with direct sowing such as oaks.

Twelve point clouds of the Corral del Veleta rock glacier, in Spain, were produced with two different software packages (123D Catch and Agisoft Photoscan), using Low Dynamic Range images and High Dynamic Range compositions (HDR) for three different years (2011, 2012 and 2014). The accuracy of the resulting point clouds was assessed using benchmark models acquired every year with a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. Three parameters were used to estimate the accuracy of each point cloud: the RMSE, the Cloud-to-Cloud distance (C2C) and the Multiscale-Model-to-Model comparison (M3C2). The M3C2 mean error ranged from 0.084 m (standard deviation of 0.403 m) to 1.451 m (standard deviation of 1.625 m). Agisoft Photoscan overcome 123D Catch, producing more accurate and denser point clouds in 11 out 12 cases, being this work, the first available comparison between both software packages in the literature. No significant improvement was observed using HDR pre-processing. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the geometrical accuracy of 3D models obtained using LDR and HDR compositions are compared. These findings may be of interest for researchers who wish to estimate geomorphic changes using SfM-MVS approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2072-4292			WOS:000360818800036	J	"Javier Zamora-Camacho, Francisco; Virtudes Rubino-Hispan, Maria; Reguera, Senda; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio"								Thermal dependence of sprint performance in the lizard Psammo-dromus algirus along a 2200-meter elevational gradient: Cold-habitat lizards do not perform better at low temperatures								JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				52				90	96		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.06.003			Aug-15	2015	Sprint speed has a capital relevance in most animals' fitness, mainly for fleeing from predators. Sprint performance is maximal within a certain range of body temperatures in ectotherms, whose thermal upkeep relies on exogenous thermal sources. Ectotherms can respond to diverse thermal environments either by shifting their thermal preferences or maintaining them through different adaptive mechanisms. Here, we tested whether maximum sprint speed of a lizard that shows conservative thermal ecology along a 2200-meter elevational gradient differs with body temperature in lizards from different elevations. Lizards ran faster at optimum than at suboptimum body temperature. Notably, high-elevation lizards were not faster than mid- and low-elevation lizards at suboptimum body temperature, despite their low-quality thermal environment. This result suggests that both preferred body temperature and thermal dependence of speed performance are co-adapted along the elevational gradient. High-elevation lizards display a number of thermoregulatory strategies that allow them to achieve high optimum body temperatures in a low thermal-quality habitat and thus maximize speed performance. As for reproductive condition, we did not find any effect of it on sprint speed, or any significant interaction with elevation or body temperature. However, strikingly, gravid females were significantly slower than males and non-gravid females at suboptimum temperature, but performed similarly well at optimal temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This upward migration of lowland species will surely result in contact with related species inhabiting high-mountain ecosystems. We propose that an overlooked consequence of this upland movement is the possibility for interspecific hybridization between narrowly endemic alpine plants and widely distributed lowland plants. Genetic swamping due to introgressive hybridization might even lead to the genetic extinction of the endemic species, without any apparent detrimental demographic effect. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has long been ignored in the ecological literature, probably because is widely assumed that the ecological effects of climate change are more detrimental than its genetic effects. We tested our idea by searching for human-induced hybridization in a worldwide hotspot biodiversity, the high-mountains of the Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). About 25 % of the endemic flora is already hybridizing in these mountains, mostly with widespread lowland congeners. Some species are even already threatened due to genetic swamping. It is thereby urgent including in future conservation agendas a protocol for detecting and monitoring positive and negative effects of genetic swamping mediated by climate change in high mountains and other sensitive ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000358643500001	J	"Lei, Shufei; Iles, Alastair; Kelly, Maggi"								Characterizing the Networks of Digital Information that Support Collaborative Adaptive Forest Management in Sierra Nevada Forests								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				56	1			94	109		10.1007/s00267-015-0497-x			Jul-15	2015	Some of the factors that can contribute to the success of collaborative adaptive management-such as social learning, open communication, and trust-are built upon a foundation of the open exchange of information about science and management between participants and the public. Despite the importance of information transparency, the use and flow of information in collaborative adaptive management has not been characterized in detail in the literature, and currently there exist opportunities to develop strategies for increasing the exchange of information, as well as to track information flow in such contexts. As digital information channels and networks have been increased over the last decade, powerful new information monitoring tools have also been evolved allowing for the complete characterization of information products through their production, transport, use, and monitoring. This study uses these tools to investigate the use of various science and management information products in a case study-the Sierra Nevada Adaptive Management Project-using a mixed method (citation analysis, web analytics, and content analysis) research approach borrowed from the information processing and management field. The results from our case study show that information technologies greatly facilitate the flow and use of digital information, leading to multiparty collaborations such as knowledge transfer and public participation in science research. We conclude with recommendations for expanding information exchange in collaborative adaptive management by taking advantage of available information technologies and networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000355621100008	25877459J	"Zamora, Regino; Miguel Barea-Azcon, Jose"								LONG-TERM CHANGES IN MOUNTAIN PASSERINE BIRD COMMUNITIES IN THE SIERRA NEVADA (SOUTHERN SPAIN): A 30-YEAR CASE STUDY								ARDEOLA				62	1			3	18					Jun-15	2015	Shifts in composition and abundance of bird communities were studied along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada (S. Spain), comparing censuses made at the same locations in the 1980s and during 2008-2012. Censuses were made in three representative ecosystems: 1) Pyrenean oak woodland, 2) high-mountain juniper scrubland, 3) high-mountain summits. In a global change context, avian-community dynamics are related mainly to changes in two of the following drivers: climate change and land-use change occurring over the past 30 years. Our results show a continuous turnover of the bird community, with an overall 27% change in species composition, in an ecological setting that has changed little, especially in the high-mountain scrubland and summit areas. We detected an increase in species diversity relative to the 1980s, mostly in the Pyrenean oak woodland. Moreover, our results also show a sharp decrease in bird density during the 30-year study period, chiefly affecting the dominant species of the 1980s in the Pyrenean oak forest and in the high-mountain scrubland. In the high-summit ecosystems, the decline of alpine species has paralleled the uphill expansion of some mediterranean ones. The outcome of these processes is a community in continuous flux, both in composition and abundance, where interannual variability is similar to interdecadal variability. We conclude that the bird communities of Sierra Nevada are showing strong spatial and temporal dynamics that are now accelerating, perhaps because of global warming.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0570-7358			WOS:000357052300001	J	"Monforte, Laura; Nunez-Olivera, Encarnacion; Martinez-Abaigar, Javier"				"Nunez-Olivera, Encarnacion/L-7164-2014; Martinez-Abaigar, Javier/L-7000-2014"	"Nunez-Olivera, Encarnacion/0000-0002-7221-3852; Martinez-Abaigar, Javier/0000-0002-9762-9862"			UV radiation biomonitoring using cell compartmentation of UV-absorbing compounds in herbarium samples of a liverwort								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				52				48	56		10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.11.027			May-15	2015	Ultraviolet-absorbing compounds (UVACs) were analyzed in 90 herbarium samples of the liverwort Jungermannia exsertifolia subsp. cordifolia collected throughout Spain in the period 1913-2006, in order to evaluate their usefulness in UV radiation biomonitoring. This was assessed, for the first time in bryophytes, differentiating the soluble (mainly vacuolar) and insoluble (cell wall-bound) UVACs (respectively, SUVACs and IUVACs), which may represent different mechanisms to cope with UV radiation. The bulk levels of SUVACs and IUVACs, and the concentrations of seven individual compounds (five SUVACs and two IUVACs) were analyzed, and several environmental variables of the sampling points were obtained: longitude, latitude, altitude, ozone column, and modelled UV levels.Diverse positive relationships of UVAC variables with UV radiation levels were identified in both the temporal and spatial scales. The soluble compound p-coumaroylmalic acid showed significantly higher concentrations in the years after the onset of stratospheric ozone degradation (around 1975) with respect to the previous years. The bulk level and the concentrations of three individual SUVACs were higher in the Spanish samples analyzed in the present study than in the northern European samples analyzed in a previous study in which IUVACs were not considered. The bulk level of IUVACs was the biological variable best spatially correlated with the UV exposure of the samples and with important factors determining it, such as altitude and latitude. Furthermore, the bulk level of IUVACs was the biological variable selected by a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to reconstruct the past levels of UV-B radiation. The reconstructed UV-B did not show a clear trend in the period 1913-2006, which was coincident with other climatic and biological UV reconstructions. Both SUVACs and IUVACs were significant loading factors differentiating summer and autumn samples in the Principal Components Analysis conducted using both UVACs and the environmental variables, but again the bulk level of IUVACs was the main loading factor differentiating the samples collected from the highest and most UV-exposed localities (Sierra Nevada). In general, these findings suggest that UVACs were stimulated by increased UV levels in time or space, and that IUVACs would be better UV protectants than SUVACs, probably due to their more efficient screening capacity.Overall, UVACs of J. exsertifolia subsp. cordifolia were good UV biomarkers, and their location in the soluble or cell wall-bound fractions determined their usefulness in the different aspects of UV biomonitoring, including the assessment of the UV-B increase associated to anthropogenic ozone degradation. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper shows a methodological approach that combines the use of (satellite) Earth observation with ontologies to monitor Natura 2000 habitats and assess their functioning. We have created an ontological system called Savia that can describe both the ecosystem functioning and the behaviour of abiotic factors in a Natura 2000 habitat. This system is able to automatically download images from MODIS products, create indicators and compute temporal trends for them. We have developed an ontology that takes into account the different concepts and relations about indicators and temporal trends, and the spatio-temporal components of the datasets. All the information generated from datasets and MODIS images, is stored into a knowledge base according to the ontology. Users can formulate complex questions using a SPARQL end-point. This system has been tested and validated in a case study that uses Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests as a target habitat in Sierra Nevada (Spain), a Natura 2000 site. We assess ecosystem functioning using NDVI. The selected abiotic factor is snow cover. Savia provides useful data regarding these two variables and reflects relationships between them.

GIS-based calculations of snowmelt-accumulation models must deal with nonnegligible scale effects below cell size, which may result in unsatisfactory predictions depending on the study scale. Terrestrial photography, whose scales can be adapted to the study problem, is a cost-effective technique, capable of reproducing snow dynamics at subgrid scale. A series of high-frequency images were combined with a mass and energy model to reproduce snow evolution at cell scale (30 m x 30 m) by means of the assimilation of the snow cover fraction observation dataset obtained from terrestrial photography in the Sierra Nevada, southern Spain. The ensemble transform Kalman filter technique is employed. The results show the convenience of adopting a selective depletion curve parameterization depending on the succession of accumulation-melting cycles in the snow season in these highly variable environments. A reduction in the error for snow depth to 50% (from 463.87 to 261.21 mm and from 238.22 to 128.50 mm) is achieved if the appropriate curve is selected.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1525-755X	1525-7541		WOS:000352735100007	J	"Jabaloy-Sanchez, Antonio; Teresa Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria; Padron-Navarta, Jose Alberto; Lopez Sanchez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Garrido, Carlos J."

These ultramafic rocks preserve unique prograde structures related to the pre- and peak high-pressure event (1.6-1.9 GPa and 680-710 degrees C). The oldest subduction-related structures are preserved in Atg-serpentinites: a penetrative S-1 foliation and associated L-1 stretching lineation that formed in a non-coaxial regime with a top-to-the-W sense of shear. This planar-linear fabric is crosscut by olivine +/- Ti-clinohumite veins, formed during the prograde breakdown of brucite and pre-metamorphic clinopyroxene, which form a system of veins decimetres long. They record embrittlement processes due to the release of 6 vol.% of H2O associated with brucite dehydration. The growth of prograde olivine and/or tremolite porphyroblasts is syn- to post-kinematic in relation to the S-1 foliation. Further reactions at higher temperature related to the complete break-down of the Atg (i.e. Atg-out) are post-kinematic to S-1. Prograde Chl-harzburgite is crosscut by sets of conjugate zones associated with grain-size reduction of olivine grains. These grain-size reduction zones are interpreted as brittle structures generated by hydrofracturing due to overpressure fluids in a compressional setting at low-differential stresses.Structures related to the exhumation process are mainly preserved in the metasedimentary host rock, where an S-2/L-2 planar-linear fabric developed within a shear zone dominated by a non-coaxial regime with a top-to-the-W sense of movement in a transpressional regime. Peak metamorphic conditions deduced for the schists are similar in pressure (1.3-1.9 GPa) but lower in temperature (560-590 degrees C) compared to the ultramafic rocks in contact with them, suggesting a major shear zone at the base of the ultramafic massif during D-2 deformation in a right-handed transpressional regime.

Here we analyze a regionally extensive population of mappable planar surfaces, which crown several major, tectonically active sierras of the inner southeastern Betic Cordillera, SE Spain. Based on a synthesis of long-term landscape evolution involving landform reconnaissance, DEM-based morphometric analysis, structural geology, sediment provenance analysis, and field stratigraphy, we conclude that the summit surfaces are a mosaic of discrete, post-orogenic erosion surfaces that each developed in relation to Mediterranean marine base levels at a time when the sierras formed a series of low-elevation islands. They are not, therefore, fragments of a once regionally continuous paleoplain. The summit surfaces were partly the result of shallow-angle detachment faulting during the middle Miocene in response to lithospheric slab detachment. Where evidence exists that the resulting low-relief topography was reworked by marine abrasion during the Tortonian sea-level rise, the terminal age of the surfaces is latest Miocene. Age-bracketing based on strati-graphic correlations among the many depocentres of the region and on published thermochronological data indicates that some erosion surfaces locally formed in less than 3 million years (similar to 8 Ma-5.7 Ma). They were subsequently uplifted to their current elevations (1.7 to > 2 km) by Pliocene to Quaternary neotectonics in at least two major pulses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is composed of two magnetometers, oriented NS and EW, respectively. At 10 Hz, their sensitivity is 19 V/pT and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 28 dB for a time-varying signal of 1 pT, the expected field amplitude in Sierra Nevada. The station operates for frequencies below 24 Hz. The magnetometers, together with their corresponding electronics, have been specifically designed to achieve such an SNR for small signals. They are based on high-resolution search coils with ferromagnetic core and 10(6) turns, operating in limited geometry configuration. Different system noise sources are considered, and a study of the SNR is also included. Finally, some initial Schumann resonance measurements are presented in order to validate the performance of the measurement station, including 1 h length spectra, daily variations of resonance amplitudes and frequencies for the different seasons, and a 3 day spectrogram.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-6604	1944-799X		WOS:000353686900002	J	"Viedma, Olga; Quesada, Juan; Torres, Ivan; De Santis, Angela; Moreno, Jose M."

Here, we determined the role of pre-fire stand structure, directional topography, and burning conditions on fire severity in a large fire (12,697 ha) in Central Spain that burned a Pinus pinaster forest on July 2005. Fire severity was estimated using RdNBR based on Landsat 5 TM images. Forest stand structure was reconstructed by systematically sampling the burned area (n = 236). Burning conditions were established using weather information and a map of fire progression, based on which fire rate of spread and propagation direction were calculated. Topographic features in the direction of the fire-front were derived from a digital elevation model. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis was employed to relate each group of variables or the entire set to RdNBR. Fire severity was best explained by burning conditions (cross-validation correlation [CVC] 0.56), followed by pre-fire stand structure (CVC 0.34), and directional topography (CVC 0.17). Combining the three sets of variables, CVC increased to 0.71. Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning upslope, with high fire rate of spread, with heterogeneous and dense stands of P. pinaster and Quercus pyrenaica in the understory, receiving high solar radiation, among other characteristics. Fire severity was the result of interactive relationships between burning conditions, pre-fire stand structure, and directional topography. Thus, determining factors controlling fire severity from static stand structure or topography, as is often done, may not be appropriate.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000350880400005	J	"Anderson, M.

The reasons for burning in chaparral are grouped into six ecologically-based categories, each relying on a known response to fire of the chaparral flora, community, or landscape. The densities of people in the region were high, and villages needed large quantities of chaparral-derived materials with specific qualities to make many cultural objects. Because the majority of chaparral-occurring species used as cultural resources by Native groups required frequent fire in order to exist in sufficient quantity, or to be useful, fires caused by lightning strikes were likely insufficient to meet needs. The authors posit that tribes employed intentional burning to expand the availability, abundance, and diversity of plant materials necessary for foods, medicines, and critical technologies and that they collected plants and animals from across a mosaic of periodically burned chaparral stands at different stages of ecological succession. Overall the evidence suggests that the burning of chaparral, as a major strategy for economic intensification and extensification, altered the natural fire regimes of the foothills by expanding the burn season, shortening the fire-return interval in specific areas, and enhancing the abundance and density of species that suited specific cultural objectives.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0771	2162-4496		WOS:000350889000002	J	Knapp, Eric E.								Long-term dead wood changes in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest: Habitat and fire hazard implications								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				339				87	95		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.12.008			MAR 1 2015	2015	Dead trees play an important role in forests, with snags and coarse woody debris (CWD) used by many bird and mammal species for nesting, resting, or foraging. However, too much dead wood can also contribute to extreme fire behavior. This tension between dead wood as habitat and dead wood as fuel has raised questions about appropriate quantities in fire-dependent forested ecosystems. Three plots installed in mixed conifer forest of the central Sierra Nevada in 1929 illustrate how amounts and sizes of dead wood have changed through time as a result of logging and fire exclusion. Diameter of snags was measured and CWD was mapped in the old-growth condition, prior to logging. Snags were re-measured in 2007 or 2008, and CWD was re-mapped in 20112. Snag density increased from 15.2 ha(-1) in 1929 to 140.0 ha(-1) in 2007/2008. However, average snag size declined, with 72% and 22% of snags classified as medium or large in 1929 and 2007/2008, respectively. Mechanisms of tree mortality also appear to have changed with greater mortality in smaller size classes, possibly as a result of higher live tree density. CWD volume, mass, and cover did not differ significantly between 1929 and 2012, with increased tree mortality and lack of periodic consumption by fire apparently compensating for the loss of inputs of large wood due to past logging. However, number of logs increased from 28 ha-1 to 76 ha(-1) and average size declined substantially. Because larger-sized dead wood is preferred by many wildlife species, the current condition of more, smaller, and more decayed woody pieces may have a lower ratio of habitat value relative to potential fire hazard than it once did. Size, density, and stage of decomposition are therefore potentially better metrics for managing dead wood than mass and/or volume alone. To restore dead wood to conditions more like those found historically will require growing larger trees and reducing the inputs of dead wood from small and intermediate-sized trees. Fire, which preferentially consumes smaller and more rotten wood, would also help shift the balance to larger and less decayed pieces.

Therefore, simple tools to predict soil erosion risk help to decide where the available resources should be used first. In this study, a predictive model for soil erosion degree, based on ordinal logistic regression, has been developed and evaluated using data from three large forest fires in South-eastern Spain. The field data were successfully fit to the model in 60% of cases after 50 runs (i.e., agreement between observed and predicted soil erosion degrees), using slope steepness, slope aspect, and fire severity as predictors. North-facing slopes were shown to be less prone to soil erosion than the rest. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Results obtained through laboratory or mesocosm studies and measurement of contaminant concentrations in areas experiencing declines have supported a role of contaminants in these declines. The current study examines the effects of contaminant exposure to amphibians in situ in areas actually experiencing declines. Early larval Pseudacris regilla were translocated among Lassen Volcanic, Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, California, USA and caged in wetlands in 2001 and 2002 until metamorphosis. Twenty contaminants were identified in tadpoles with an average of 1.3-5.9 (maximum = 10) contaminants per animal. Sequoia National Park, which had the greatest variety and concentrations of contaminants in 2001, also had tadpoles that experienced the greatest mortality, slowest developmental rates and lowest cholinesterase activities. Yosemite and Sequoia tadpoles and metamorphs had greater genotoxicity than those in Lassen during 2001, as determined by flow cytometry. In 2001 tadpoles at Yosemite had a significantly higher rate of malformations, characterized as hemimelia (shortened femurs), than those at the other two parks but no significant differences were observed in 2002. Fewer differences in contaminant types and concentrations existed among parks during 2002 compared to 2001. In 2002 Sequoia tadpoles had higher mortality and slower developmental rates but there was no difference among parks in cholinesterase activities. Although concentrations of most contaminants were below known lethal concentrations, simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals and other stressors may have resulted in lethal and sublethal effects.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0963-9292	1573-3017		WOS:000349334000002	25381462J	"Jesus Mendoza-Fernandez, Antonio; Javier Perez-Garcia, Francisco; Martinez-Hernandez, Fabian; Salmeron-Sanchez, Esteban; Miguel Medina-Cazorla, Jose; Antonio Garrido-Becerra, Juan; Isabel Martinez-Nieto, Maria; Encarna Merlo, Maria; Francisco Mota, Juan"				"Martinez-Nieto, M.

This is a new method to recognize areas of endemism which combines the results yielded by NDM program, based on the optimality criterion, and those obtained using MARXAN software, designed to ensure the representation of species in the management of biodiversity. The method has been tested using the endemic and threatened vascular flora of the South of the Iberian Peninsula (Andalusia). Eleven areas of endemism have been identified in this territory; Sierra Nevada, Sierra Bermeja and Sierra Tejeda y Almijara stand out primarily. Although most of the areas dealt with in our study are already efficiently protected, the intermountain depression known as the Hoya de Baza, an arid area, and Sierra de Gador are exceptions. This new methodology provided a useful tool in the fine-tuning of the selection of areas of endemism. A more precise and flexible selection of scale-dependent endemicity areas was accomplished in this manner. The combination of both criteria (endemicity and threat) not only provides a reliable representation of areas of endemism, but also optimum efficiency in terms of endemicity and presence threatened of species. This approach offers a more objective and flexible strategy which can be implemented on different scales. A lot of alternatives can be generated, so the same conservation objective can be achieved by different combinations of solutions. This is a great advantage for the prioritization of territories meriting conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

The tectonic evolution of this basin is mostly controlled by strike slip master faults of the NAFS. This study examines the topography structure relationships in an effort to evaluate the tectonic signatures in the landscape, paying special attention to recent tectonic activity. In the study, the main focus is on the tectonic controls of the NAFS on the geomorphic evolution of alluvial fans and fan catchments in the Erzincan pull-apart basin. The observations of the amount of tilting of the alluvial fans (3) and its relation with morphometric (Asymmetry Factor (AF), Hypsometric Integral (HI), Fractal analysis of drainage networks (D)) properties of the fan catchments provide valuable information about the tectonic evolution of the basin area. The results of the analyses showed that the alluvial fan and fan catchment morphology in the pull-apart basin are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activity of the NAFS. The fault system in the basin has controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin, and aggradation processes by causing channel migration, channel incision and tilting the alluvial fans.

The fungus produced spores in single species cultures, using Sorghum vulgare or Trifolium pratense as bait plant. The spores are 69-96 x 65-92 gm in diameter, brownish creamy to light brown, often appearing with a grayish tint in the dissecting microscope. They have a pitted surface (pit sizes about 0.8-1.6 x 0.7-1.4 gm in diameter and 0.6-1.3 gm deep), and are similar in size to several other Acaulospora species with pitted spore surfaces, such as A. nivalis, A. paulinae and A. sieverdingii, but smaller than A. minuta, A. puncatata and A. scrobicttlata.

Sierra Nevada National Park (South Spain), with altitudes higher than 3500 m a.s.l., is part of the Global Change in Mountain Regions network. Snow occurrence just 40 km from the seaside determines a wide range of biodiversity, a snowmelt fluvial regime, and the associated ecosystem services. This work presents the local trend analysis of weather variables at this area together with additional snow-related variables. For this, long term point and distributed observations from weather stations and remote sensing sources were studied and used as input and calibration datasets of a physically based snow model to derive long term series of mean and maximum daily fraction of snow covered area, annual number of days with snow, annual number of days with precipitation, mean and maximum mean daily snow water equivalent, and snowmelt and evaporation volumes. The joint analysis of weather and snow variables showed a decrease trend in the persistence and extent of the snow cover area. The precipitation regime, rather than the temperature trend, seems to be the most relevant driver on the snow regime forcing in Mediterranean areas. This poses a constraint for rigorous scenario analysis in these regions, since the precipitation pattern is poorly approximated by climatic models in these regions.

These rocks are present in the European area along the Italian and French Alps, in the North-East area of Portugal, in the Sierra Nevada Massif (Spain) and in Greece. In particular, crystalline rocks are also widespread in Calabria and a high percentage of these rocks is present in the Sila, Serre and Aspromonte Massifs. Fresh or weathered crystalline rocks, highly fractured, may be affected by deep-seated landslides due to the presence of tectonic structures, which may predispose and control the landslide mechanisms. The Serra di Buda landslide, near the town of Acri (Cosenza), can be included among the deep-seated landslides which affect weathered crystalline rocks. Starting from the geological model, the analysis of the geotechnical data (digital terrain model, borehole logs, piezometer levels, superficial and deep displacements, geomaterial characteristics, etc.) allows to detect the uncertainties inherent the elements that concur to define the geotechnical model. To reduce some of these uncertainties a calibration by means of numerical modelling is carried out, and the results obtained show the usefulness of this approach.					12th International IAEG Congress12th International IAEG Congress	SEP 15-19, 2014SEP 15-19, 2014	IAEGIAEG	Torino, ITALYTorino, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0					"978-3-319-09057-3; 978-3-319-09056-6"	WOS:000358988100223	B	"Navarro, Rafael; Sanchez-Valverde, Josefina; Manuel Baltuille, Jose"						"Lollino, G; Manconi, A; Guzzetti, F; Culshaw, M; Bobrowsky, P; Luino, F"		"The Natural Stone in the Historic Buildings of the City of Granada (Southern Spain).

There are three main lithotypes extracted in the province of Granada which are present in most of the heritage buildings in the city centre. These rocks are known as ""Santa Pudia"" calcarenite (Tortonian), ""Sierra Elvira"" limestone (Lias) and ""Alfacar"" travertine (Quaternary). It gives an outstanding aesthetic and ornamental richness to the city. Besides these, there are other lithologies from the province, such as conglomerate from El Turro, marble from Lanjaron, limestone from Loja and serpentinite from Sierra Nevada, which have also been used occasionally. In this paper we show a detailed characterization of these materials, including quarry provenance, main mineralogical and physical characteristics, main uses in different buildings and major deterioration problems that these stones may have. An adequate knowledge of the materials with which the different architectural elements of the city were built, contribute to executing appropriate restoration and contribute to the proper maintenance of the heritage of the city. With this contribution we suggest that the province of Granada should be considered as a ""Global Heritage Stone Province"", given that the richness and variety of natural stone used in its monuments is more than proven."					12th International IAEG Congress12th International IAEG Congress	SEP 15-19, 2014SEP 15-19, 2014	IAEGIAEG	Torino, ITALYTorino, ITALY	1	0	0	0	0	1					"978-3-319-09048-1; 978-3-319-09047-4"	WOS:000359015000044	S	"Navarro, Rafael; Pereira, Dolores; Rodriguez-Navarro, Carlos; Sebastian-Pardo, Eduardo"						"Pereira, D; Marker, BR; Kramar, S; Cooper, BJ; Schouenborg, BE"		The Sierra Nevada serpentinites: the serpentinites most used in Spanish heritage buildings								GLOBAL HERITAGE STONE: TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF BUILDING AND ORNAMENTAL STONES		Geological Society Special Publication		407				101	108		10.1144/SP407.7			2015	2015	Serpentinites from Sierra Nevada (Granada, south of Spain) have traditionally been used as ornamental elements in historical buildings, both indoors and outdoors. The cathedral, the Palace of Charles V, the Royal Chancellery in Granada and some others are good examples of their use. Outside Granada, the serpentinites are seen at the monastery of El Escorial, The Royal Palace and the convent of Las Salesas Reales, all of them part of Madrid's architectural heritage, although there are much more examples to be found across the country. There are two quarries located in Sierra Nevada that supplied all the material to make the different elements in the above buildings. In this work, we report a thorough characterization of the main characteristics of the serpentinites from Sierra Nevada in order to propose this stone as a possible candidate as a 'Global Heritage Stone Resource'. This work is important for duly recognizing a natural stone that has been profusely used in the past in the construction of a magnificent heritage of important cities, and historical quarries should be protected so that they can provide original material if required to do so in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0305-8719		978-1-86239-685-2	WOS:000359401200010	S	"Pimentel, Rafael; Herrero, Javier; Polo, Maria Jose"				Polo, Maria J./L-8018-2014	Polo, Maria J./0000-0002-6296-2198	"Chen, Y; Neale, C; Cluckie, I; Su, Z; Zhou, J; Huang, Q; Xu, Z"		Snow evolution in a semi-arid mountainous area combining snow modelling and Landsat spectral mixture analysis								REMOTE SENSING AND GIS FOR HYDROLOGY AND WATER RESOURCES		IAHS Publication		368				33	39					2015	2015	"This study proposes the use of both physically-distributed hydrological modelling in combination with satellite remote sensing images, to study the evolution of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, in southern Spain.

Nevertheless, as both kinds of strategies consume resources, animals cannot maximize investment in both strategies simultaneously, which should lead to trade-offs between the two. Accordingly, we hypothesize that there is a trade-off between sprint capacity and immune response, which are among the most important antipredatory and antiparasitic strategies, respectively, of many animals. Consequently, we predict that animals eliciting an immune response should reduce their sprint capacity. We experimentally tested this prediction in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. A group of lizards was inoculated with the antigen LPS (lipopolysaccharide of the cell wall of Escherichia coli), which activates the immune system, whereas the other group (control) was inoculated with phosphate buffer, which has no physiological effect. Before and after the inoculations, we filmed sprint capacity of lizards, estimating the maximal sprint speed. Males were faster than females before the activation of their immune system. Nonetheless, males' sprint speed diminished after the inoculation of LPS, whereas females' did not. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a trade-off between sprint speed and immune response in males. Consequently, male lizards combating a pathogen may suffer either higher risk of predation, or reduced fitness if they avoid this risk by spending more time in shelter.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000351929300017	J	"Puglisi, Marta; Kuerschner, Harald; Privitera, Maria"								The Schistidio atrofusci-Grimmietum pulvinatae, a new association of the class Grimmietea anodontis on the Mediterranean mountains								NOVA HEDWIGIA				100	01-Feb			205	214		10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2014/0213			2015	2015	The new association Schistidio atrofusci-Grimmietum pulvinatae of the class Grimmietea anodontis, found in many mountain areas of the Mediterranean region, is here described.

Relationships between quartz weathering and soil type (Entisol, Inceptisol and Alfisol) in Sierra Nevada (southeast Spain)								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE				66	1	SI		179	193		10.1111/ejss.12214			Jan-15	2015	Quartz was studied in a soil development sequence of Entisol-Inceptisol-Alfisol in a Mediterranean mountain climate on a metamorphic quartz-rich substrate, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and backscattered electron (BSE) and electron microprobes (EMP), with fine sand (250-50 mu m) as the selected particle-size fraction. The quartz in the soil is inherited mainly from the parent rock. However, a study of the surface characteristics of the quartz grains and measurement of non-Si elements (Al3+, Ti4+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+), both near-edge and in the centre of grains, showed that the quartz is altered substantially in the progression parent rock < Entisol < Inceptisol < Alfisol, and in the A, AC and Bt horizons rather than in the C horizon. In all profiles and horizons the content of non-Si elements was greater in the near-edge zones than in the centre of the grain. This pedochemical process thus operates mainly at the surface of the grain and results in a variety of pits, fissures and other corrosion features (hole or corrosion gulf, opening of inter-granular surfaces, areal alteration, smoothing of edges of conchoidal fractures, and deepening of incisions of conchoidal fractures). Estimation of the W index, which assesses the intensity of the weathering process from the size and density of the etch pits, revealed that many of the quartz grains had alterations somewhat similar to the quartzes of tropical soils. This study casts doubt on the paradigm of quartz inalterability in soils of little to medium pedological change in temperate zones.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1351-0754	1365-2389		WOS:000348520600020	J	"Perez, Jesus M.; Serrano, Emmanuel; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Gonzalez, Francisco J.; Sarasa, Mathieu; Granados, Jose E.; Cano-Manuel, Francisco J.; Cuenca, Rafaela; Fandos, Paulino"				"Fandos, Paulino/M-7304-2015; CESAM, UA/M-3762-2015; Serrano Ferron, Emmanuel/J-4489-2013"	"Fandos, Paulino/0000-0002-9607-8931; Serrano Ferron, Emmanuel/0000-0002-9799-9804"			DISTINGUISHING DISEASE EFFECTS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN A MOUNTAIN UNGULATE: SEASONAL VARIATION IN BODY WEIGHT, HEMATOLOGY, AND SERUM CHEMISTRY AMONG IBERIAN IBEX (CAPRA PYRENAICA) AFFECTED BY SARCOPTIC MANGE								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				51	1			148	156		10.7589/2014-01-008			Jan-15	2015	Our study focuses on the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) from the Sierra Nevada Natural Space (southern Spain), where sarcoptic mange is an endemic disease and animals are affected by a highly seasonal environment. Our aim was to distinguish between disease and environmental influences on seasonal variation in body weight, hematology, and serum biochemistry in Iberian ibex. We sampled 136 chemically immobilized male ibexes. The single effect of mange influenced hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, leukocytes, band neutrophils, monocytes, cholesterol, urea, creatine, and aspartate aminotransferase. Both mange and the period of the year also affected values of mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, neutrophils, glucose, and serum proteins. Scabietic animals showed a marked reduction in body weight (21.4 kg on average), which was more pronounced in winter. These results reveal that 1) infested animals are anemic, 2) secondary infections likely occur, and 3) sarcoptic mange is catabolic.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0090-3558	1943-3700		WOS:000348001200015	25380360J	"Gaston, J.; Morente-Benitez, F.

The Sierra Nevada is one of the most studied mountain ranges in southern Europe regarding its environmental evolution. The purpose of the present paper is to integrate and summarize all the studies focused on the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental history in this massif since the Last Glaciation. Research has focused both on different sedimentary records and historical sources. A wide range of geomorphological, sedimentological and geochronological techniques have been used to characterize the glacial, periglacial, wetland and lacustrine records for palaeoenvironmental purposes. For the last nine centuries tens of descriptions, maps and sketches describe the landscape of the summit area of the Sierra Nevada, providing evidences of the historical environmental events. Based on a multi-proxy approach, five periods have been identified: Last Glaciation, deglaciation, Holocene, Little Ice Age and recent evolution. Recent studies have detected the maximum expansion of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada around 30-32 ka BP, predating the global temperature minimum. No data about the environmental evolution is available between 20-30 ka BP. Around 19-20 ka BP glaciers advanced significantly. The process of deglaciation was rapid and around 14-15 ka BP the massif was almost free of ice. The Late Glacial promoted the formation of small glaciers in the highest northern cirques and widespread active periglacial processes (i.e. rock glaciers). During the Holocene there has been an alternation of colder/warmer periods and changing moisture conditions. Periglacial processes have been generally widespread in the summit area, with an increasing or decreasing activity depending on climate conditions. Ephemeral reappearance of small glacial cirques occurred in the highest northern cirques during the coldest and wettest phases. This is the case of the Little Ice Age, as revealed by historical documents and sedimentary records. Since the last decades of the XIX century the temperature has increased similar to 0.93 degrees C leading to a decrease of the intensity of periglacial processes in the high lands of the Sierra Nevada.

This information is highly relevant to human well-being, which is the motivation of ecosystem services assessments. We present results from an analysis of stakeholders' perceptions of ecosystem services, well-being and drivers of change in two semi-arid watersheds in south-eastern Spain. Based on the information compiled through a literature review, participant observation and semi-structured interviews, we designed a questionnaire and conducted 381 interviews. Our results show that semiarid watersheds deliver a large variety of ecosystem services; however, these services are perceived in different ways. We identified five stakeholder groups, including: locals dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, locals not directly dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, environmental and local development professionals and rural and nature tourists. Overall, provisioning services related to traditional practices were perceived as highly important and highly vulnerable by every stakeholder group. However, we found contrasting perceptions of some ecosystem services among stakeholders and of the relevant drivers of change and wellbeing. We suggest that socio-cultural valuation is a useful tool to prioritize ecosystem services but more attention should be directed to emerging trade-offs. Linking values to other stakeholder perceptions might be a useful way to move forward in ecosystem services valuation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Originally formulated for endotherms, it is controversial whether Bergmann's Rule may be applicable to ectotherms, given that larger ectotherms show diminished capacity for heating up. We predict that Bergmann's Rule will be applicable to ectotherms when the benefits of a higher conservation of heat due to a larger body size overcompensate for decreased capacity to heating up. We test this hypothesis in the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which shows increased body size with elevation in Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). We measured heating and cooling rates of lizards from different elevations (from 300 to 2500m above sea level) under controlled conditions. We found no significant differences in the heating rate along an elevational gradient. However, the cooling rate diminished with elevation and body size: highland lizards, with larger masses, have a higher thermal inertia for cooling, which allows them to maintain heat for more time and keep a high body temperature despite the lower thermal availability. Consequently, the net gaining of heat increased with elevation and body size. This study highlights that the heat conservation mechanism for explaining Bergmann's Rule works and is applicable to ectotherms, depending on the thermal benefits and costs associated with larger body sizes.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000346280100023	25387908J	"Trepet, S.

Fourteen local tur groupings were united into three groups by the similarity of long-term number dynamics. A negative effect of winter, which deviated from the average long-term winter by the level of snowiness, on the tur population was detected. Snowy winters damage not only males (that frequently die in avalanches), but also affect the birth rate subsequently; the portion of females, in spite of the male death, decreases anyway two years after winter, as well as the portion of underyearlings. It was demonstrated that the snowy winter effect is manifested only when the animal density is rather high. The following tendency was detected for the tur population: the greater the density before the winter, the larger the decrease in the animal density after it (and this tendency weakens one year after the winter). Wolf predation has no negative effect on the tur population in the reserve. A maximal association between the tur density and wolf density was found at a tur density up to 50 individuals/1000 hectares. With a further increase in the victim density, the wolf density changes independently of the tur density. Turs in the reserve are not easily accessible to poachers due to habitat peculiarities, and therefore, the role of poaching in the dynamics of their numbers is not significant."									0	0	0	0	0	0			1062-3590	1026-3470		WOS:000345398700007	J	"Zamora-Camacho, Francisco J.; Reguera, Senda; Virtudes Rubino-Hispan, M.; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio"				Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/K-7068-2014	"REGUERA PANIZO, SENDA/0000-0002-3867-9210; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/0000-0002-6726-7215"			Effects of Limb Length, Body Mass, Gender, Gravidity, and Elevation on Escape Speed in the Lizard Psammodromus algirus								EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				41	4			509	517		10.1007/s11692-014-9285-4			Dec-14	2014	Most animals rely on their escape speed to flee from predators. Here, we test several hypotheses on the evolution of escape speed in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. We test that: (1) Longer limbs should improve speed sprint. (2) Heavier lizards should be impaired regarding their sprint speed ability, suggesting a trade-off between fat storage and escape capability. (3) Males should achieve faster speeds due to their higher exposure to predators. (4) Gravid females, with increased body mass, should perform lower speed than non-gravid females. And (5) there are inter-population differences in sprint speed across an elevational gradient. We measured lizards sprint speed in a lineal raceway in the laboratory, filming races in standardized conditions and then calculating their maximal speed. We found that hind limb length greatly determined maximal sprint speed, lizards with longer limbs being faster. In parallel, higher body masses reduced maximal speed, which points to a trade-off between fat storage and escaping capability. Sexual differences also arose, as males were faster than females, as a consequence of males having longer limbs. Regarding females, gravidity did not impair maximal sprint speed, suggesting adaptations which compensate for the increased body mass. Finally, we found no elevational trend in both limbs length and sprint speed. In any case, this study suggests that selection on escape capacity may cast morphological evolution, and affect other life-history traits, such as fat storage and reproduction.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0071-3260	1934-2845		WOS:000344862900001	J	"Oliva, Marc; Gomez Ortiz, Antonio; Salvador, Ferran; Salva, Montserrat; Pereira, Paulo; Geraldes, Miguel"								Long-term soil temperature dynamics in the Sierra Nevada, Spain								GEODERMA				235				170	181		10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.07.012			Dec-14	2014	Soil temperatures play a key role on the dynamics of geomorphological processes in periglacial environments. However, little is known about soil thermal dynamics in periglacial environments of semiarid mid-latitude mountains, where seasonal frost is dominant.From September 2006 to August 2012 we have monitored soil temperatures at different depths (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm) in a solifluction landform located at 3005 m.a.s.l. in the summit area of the Sierra Nevada (South Spain). Mean annual temperatures in the first meter of the soil ranged from 3.6 to 3.9 degrees C while the mean annual air temperature at the nearby Veleta peak was 0.08 degrees C. Therefore, these data point out the inexistence of widespread permafrost conditions today in this massif. Seasonal frost controls the geomorphodynamics even in the highest lands. Climate conditions have shown a large interannual variability, as it is characteristic in a high mountainous Mediterranean environment. These variations are reflected in the patterns of soil thermal dynamics. The depth and duration of the frozen layer are strongly conditioned by the thickness of the snow cover. The date of the first significant snowfalls conditioned the beginning and rhythm of freezing of the soil. Wet years resulted in a thick snow cover which insulated the ground from external climate oscillations and favored a shallow frost layer (2008-2009,2009-2010 and 2010-2011). On the other hand, years with low precipitations promoted deeper freezing of the soil down to 60-70 cm extending until late May or early June (2006-2007,2007-2008 and 2011-2012). When snow melted a high increase of temperatures of 10-12 degrees C in few weeks was recorded at all depths. At this time of the year, periglacial activity is enhanced due to higher water availability and the existence of freeze-thaw cycles. These were recorded mostly in spring and autumn in the first 50 cm depth of the soil, ranging from 9.8 days (at 2 cm) to 3.7 days (at 50 cm).However, the inactivity of solifluction landforms suggests that the combination of present-day soil temperatures together with moisture conditions is not favorable to promote solifluction activity in the periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada.Future climate scenarios point to a temperature increase and precipitation decrease in the area, which would entail deeper but shorter frozen soil layers. These conditions would not be favorable for active periglacial slope processes in the Sierra Nevada. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the epidemiology of 10 selected pathogens (Aujeszky's disease virus - ADV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus - PRRSV, porcine influenza virus, porcine circovirus, porcine parvovirus, Erysipelotrix rhusiopathiae, Leptospira pomona, Chlamydia/Chlamydiaceae sp., Salmonella sp. and Mycobacterium bovis) in the wild boar population in Sierra Nevada National Park (SNNP), an open unfenced area, is reported, taking into account wild boar population abundance variation in space and time in an open unfenced environment A total of 1103 wild boar were sampled in 141 hunting events randomly carried out for sampling in seven hunting seasons (October to February from 2002-2003 to 2009-2010 (except 2007-2008). Prevalence was overall lower than those previously reported for fenced wild boar populations in Spain, but all the pathogens analyzed except PRRSV were considered endemic in the SNNP. ADV, E. rhusiopathiae and total pathogen prevalence were positively correlated to wild boar density. Prevalence in the positive areas was significantly higher in females for ADV, E. rhusiopathiae, L. pomona, Chlamydia/Chlamydiaceae sp. and Salmonella sp., and in males for M. bovis. This longitudinal study provides the first data on the health status of the relatively unmanaged and low density wild boar population of SNNP. It is concluded that non-intensively managed wild boar populations are able to maintain the circulation of several pathogens, even in low prevalences and in open unfenced areas with natural density variation both in time and space.

Based on geomorphological mapping, cosmogenic exposure dating and previous studies of lacustrine sediment cores, the different deposits were dated and a sequence of geomorphological and paleoenvironmental events was established as follows: (1) The Marbore Cirque was at least partially deglaciated before 12.7kyrBP. (2) Some ice masses are likely to have persisted in the Early Holocene, although their moraines were destroyed by the advance of glaciers during the Mid Holocene and LIA'. (3) A glacial expansion occurred during the Mid Holocene (5.1 +/- 0.1kyr), represented by a large push moraine that enclosed a unique ice mass at the foot of the Monte Perdido Massif. (4) A melting phase occurred at approximately 3.4 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.1kyr (Bronze/Iron Ages) after one of the most important glacial advances of the Neoglacial period. (5) Another glacial expansion occurred during the Dark Age Cold Period (1.4-1.2kyr), followed by a melting period during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. (6) The LIA' represented a clear stage of glacial expansion within the Marbore Cirque. Two different pulses of glaciation were detected, separated by a short retraction. The first pulse occurred most likely during the late 17th century or early 18th century (Maunder Minimum), whereas the second occurred between 1790 and ad1830 (Dalton Minimum). A strong deglaciation process has affected the Marbore Cirque glaciers since the middle of the 19th century.

The biodiversity and ecosystems protected by these areas deliver several ecosystem services. Recently, besides increasing global protected coverage, there has been a growing demand to assess the adequacy of protected areas management. In this study, we assessed how the management of protected areas can deal with ecosystem services taking as example the Don ana and Sierra Nevada protected areas (Spain). For that aim we analyzed the protected area management plans, mapped seven ecosystem services, and assessed how they are affected by protected area zoning and land-use intensity. We found that although provisioning and cultural services are included in the management plans of the protected areas under a different terminology, regulating services are barely addressed. Ecosystem service delivery varies depending on several factors including the protection category of the protected areas (protection intensity), land-use intensity and geomorphological factors, among others. Therefore, we discuss that integrating ecosystem services in protected area management requires dealing with complexity, necessitating the establishment of specific goals for ecosystem service delivery, which include ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000343717900006	J	"Cas, Raymond A.

In addition, our understanding of the effects of the ambient water mass and the way in which erupting magma and water interact, and the ways in which the physical properties of the water mass control and influence eruption styles, dispersal processes and deposit characteristics, is still at a relatively early stage. In particular, in the past there has been a very simplistic approach to assessing constraints on eruption styles using only ambient hydrostatic pressure, whereas equally important properties such as bulk modulus, compressibility, deformability, attenuation properties, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, have not been adequately considered. This review summarises our understanding on these issues, and briefly summarises varying eruption conditions, styles and deposit characteristics.The origin of pumice deposits preserved in subaqueous settings needs to be interpreted with care. They could represent local explosive events, but could also represent pumice sourced from distant explosive events and vents, even subaerial, and deposited by fallout through water, the passage of pyroclastic flows into water from subaerial vents, long distance rafting of buoyant pumice by currents, reworking and resedimentation, and even non-explosive subaqueous vesiculation and quench fragmentation of subaqueously erupted lavas in shallow or even deep water.The Miocene Cabo de Gata volcanic succession of southeastern Spain was deposited in shallow marine environments based on interbedded fossiliferous limestones, which represent periods of volcanic hiatus. The volcanic facies are consistent with a shallow marine setting, involving eruption of low volatile bearing magmas to form andesite and dacite lava flows, domes and associated hyaloclastites, as well as eruptions of volatile rich rhyolitic magmas that produced pumice deposits erupted from subaerial vents or vents at water depths that were too shallow to suppress explosive eruptions through the effects of hydrostatic pressure, but were then reworked and resedimented.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2038-1719	2038-1727		WOS:000345057700003	J	"Mira, Oscar; Martinez, Juan G.; Dawson, Deborah A.; Tinaut, Alberto; Sanchez-Prieto, Cristina"				"Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014; Mira, Oscar/N-3823-2014"	"Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620; Mira, Oscar/0000-0002-4966-0136"			"Twenty new microsatellite loci for population structure and parentage studies of Parnassius apollo nevadensis (Lepidoptera; Papilionidae)"								JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				18	5			771	779		10.1007/s10841-014-9683-z			Oct-14	2014	"We characterized 20 new microsatellite loci isolated from Parnassius apollo nevadensis.

We performed a regional assessment of earthquake-triggered slope instabilities in the western part of the range to determine the most likely types of failures from such an earthquake in the region and suggest where such failures have a higher likelihood of occurring. These results are broadly useful for management of regional life-lines and future development. First, a slope-instability inventory of the Sierra Nevada was produced to identify the most common instability types. Subsequently, the Newmark's sliding rigid-block methodology, implemented in a geographic information system, was used to obtain the distribution of Newmark displacements in the area considering a M (w) 6.6 earthquake on the Padul Fault. The Newmark displacements were then compared to the distribution of the inventoried slope instabilities to identify the areas where seismicity could reactivate old slope instabilities or generate new ones, and to identify the involved landslide typology. The most likely seismically induced slope instabilities in the Sierra Nevada are rock falls and rock slides. These types of instabilities could be triggered by Newmark displacements of 2 cm or less.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000342166000015	J	"Moreno, Javier; Palomo, Ignacio; Escalera, Javier; Martin-Lopez, Berta; Montes, Carlos"				"PALOMO, IGNACIO/D-4398-2014; "	"PALOMO, IGNACIO/0000-0002-4573-5989; Martin-Lopez, Berta/0000-0003-2622-0135"			Incorporating ecosystem services into ecosystem-based management to deal with complexity: a participative mental model approach								LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY				29	8			1407	1421		10.1007/s10980-014-0053-8			Oct-14	2014	Integrating ecosystem services into ecosystem-based management (EBM) is currently one of the most relevant challenges for management. For that purpose, it is necessary to depict the relationships established between ecosystems and society considering the delivery, use and governance of ecosystem services. One effective way of doing so involves collaboration between researchers, who scientifically study the system, and managers, who have specific experience and technical knowledge. With this aim, we held two workshops in 2011 in the National Parks of Doana and Sierra Nevada, Andalusia (Spain), with researchers and managers from the protected areas at different organizational levels: local, regional and national. Taking the participative mental model technique as an inspiration, we developed a tool that was used as a means to allow a holistic analysis of ecosystem services from an interdisciplinary and participative perspective. We found that participatory mental models, help integrating ecosystem services into EBM as it includes stakeholders' proposals and knowledge. For the implementation of ecosystem services for management, we discuss the necessity of navigating a process that requires considerable changes, not only in using new concepts such as ecosystem services, but also in the management structures that govern the services. This process would require closer interaction between citizens, researchers and managers, and the creation of new participation spaces that include ecosystem service beneficiaries located beyond protected areas.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0921-2973	1572-9761		WOS:000342078600011	J	"Pascual, Javier; Garcia-Lopez, Marina; Carmona, Cristina; Sousa, Thiciana da S.; de Pedro, Nuria; Cautain, Bastien; Martin, Jesus; Vicente, Francisca; Reyes, Fernando; Bills, Gerald F.; Genilloud, Olga"				"Reyes, Fernando/G-4027-2013; Martin-Serrano, Jesus/M-1937-2014; vicente, francisca/N-5126-2014; Genilloud, Olga/I-2779-2015"	"Reyes, Fernando/0000-0003-1607-5106; Martin-Serrano, Jesus/0000-0001-7487-2790; vicente, francisca/0000-0003-3198-9205; Genilloud, Olga/0000-0002-4202-1219"			Pseudomonas soli sp nov., a novel producer of xantholysin congeners								SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				37	6			412	416		10.1016/j.syapm.2014.07.003			Sep-14	2014	A chemoorganotrophic Gram-negative bacterium was isolated by means of a diffusion sandwich system from a soil sample from the Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain. Strain F-279,208(T) was oxidase and catalase positive, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming and motile by single polar flagellum. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD genes revealed that strain F-279,208(T) belongs to the Pseudomonas putida group with Pseudomonas mosselii and Pseudomonas entomophila as its closest relatives. DNA-DNA hybridization assays and phenotypic traits confirmed that this strain belongs to a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F-279,208(T) (=DSM 28043(T) = LMG 27941(T)), and during fermentation it produces xantholysins, a family of lipodepsipeptides. The major compound, xantholysin A, showed an interesting activity in a RCC4 kidney tumor cell line with inactivation of VHL linked with the HIF pathway, without any cytotoxic effects against other human tumor cell lines tested including, liver, pancreas and breast.

Between 1991 and 2012, different geomatic techniques - total station, global positioning system, close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanner - were applied to monitor the movement of cryosphere landforms in the high mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. The applied techniques must be adapted to the dynamic conditions of cryospheric environments, and so there is no ideal general technique, and depending on the characteristics of the geomorphological structure to be studied, different geomatic techniques can be used. However, there are situations in which certain instruments cannot be used: global positioning system-real time kinematics shows difficulties when the presence of vertical walls cause a multipath' effect. The technique that provides the best results in each case must be chosen, although they can all give good results in measuring and monitoring geomorphological processes. This paper analyses the techniques used and results on vertical and horizontal changes of glaciers, rock glaciers and ice patches in the Sierra Nevada, Pyrenees and Picos de Europa, and differences among them by location and topoclimatic setting. All glaciers and rock glaciers show a thinning tendency and annual variations in the flow velocity. In addition to the specific dynamic analysis, the geomatic techniques can be used to detail scale and volume changes and perimeter of the analysed landforms.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0435-3676	1468-0459		WOS:000341587900005	J	"Valverde, J.; Calatayud, J.; Gomez, J.M.; Perfectti, F."

Plants generally show a high diversity of floral visitors, making generalism a more common condition than expected. Furthermore floral visitor community seems to have spatio-temporal fluctuations in diversity and composition. Those variations respond to plant intrinsic and extrinsic factors and can affect to evolutionary and ecological aspects of plant populations. Here we assess the temporal variation in the floral visitor assemblage of the generalist plant Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We set up two experimental plots homogenizing for spatial and microenvironmental conditions to ascertain only the temporal variations in the floral visitors assemblage. During the flowering season we did daily censuses of the floral visitors, determining them to morpho-species level and clumped them in 16 functional groups based on morphological and behavioral characteristics. We found a high diversity for the whole assemblage in both experimental plots with high temporal fluctuations during the flowering season. Our results suggest an important species turnover with high fluctuations in relative abundance for some functional groups, which may turn into important ecological and evolutionary consequences.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1697-2473			ZOOREC:ZOOR15111074867	J	"Camero, A.; Zurita, C.; Gutierrez-Soto, J.; Ozbey Arabaci, M.; Nespoli, E.; Kiaeerad, F.; Beklen, E.; Garcia-Rojas, J.; Caballero-Garcia, M."

We utilized tools from complex network theory to assess the robustness to species extinction of two Spanish alpine pollination networks. A comparison with ten additional alpine and subalpine pollination (ASP) networks allowed us to give our assessment a broader scope and provide a general view of ASP network robustness. We found a broad range of robustness among ASP networks. The two Spanish pollination networks ranked intermediate to high in robustness. This could be due to two of their structural features, connectance (proportion of potential interactions actually observed) and asymmetry (normalized difference between pollinator and plant richness), which showed a positive relationship with network robustness. A finer-scale focus on the two Spanish networks did not reveal differences between endemic and nonendemic plants in their functional role within the network but indicated that they differed in their robustness to pollinator extinction. Contrasting patterns across networks suggested that endemic robustness depends on community particularities. To improve the utility of robustness assessment as a conservation tool, we should increase our understanding on (1) the order in which network species will get extinct, (2) how species rewire once they have lost their partners, and (3) how much species depend on their mutualistic interaction.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1523-0430	1938-4246		WOS:000341282400005	J	"Ubide, Teresa; Gale, Carlos; Larrea, Patricia; Arranz, Enrique; Lago, Marceliano; Tierz, Pablo"				"Larrea Marquez, Patricia/D-2759-2009; Arranz Yague, Enrique/K-9022-2014; Gale, Carlos/K-9151-2014; "	"Larrea Marquez, Patricia/0000-0001-8470-2840; Arranz Yague, Enrique/0000-0002-0710-9178; Gale, Carlos/0000-0002-2745-0357; Ubide, Teresa/0000-0002-2944-8736"			The Relevance of Crystal Transfer to Magma Mixing: a Case Study in Composite Dykes from the Central Pyrenees								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				55	8			1535	1559		10.1093/petrology/egu033			Aug-14	2014	Two composite dykes containing abundant mafic enclaves within a felsic host crop out in the Maladeta Plutonic Complex, Pyrenees, Spain. Field, petrographic and geochemical criteria reveal mixing between gabbroic and aplitic magmas, giving rise to a variety of hybrid compositions. The rocks contain spongy plagioclase, quartz ocelli and amphibole-biotite clots that are interpreted as early crystals destabilized by reaction with the hybrid melts. Spongy plagioclase and quartz ocelli were mechanically transferred from the felsic to the mafic magma, whereas amphibole-biotite clots are former pyroxene crystals from the mafic magma. Multivariate statistics (principal component analysis) have been used to examine variations in the mineral trace element compositions, which are best explained by the crystal transfer process. This study shows that crystal transfer represents a mixing mechanism that can overcome some of the physical limitations of interaction between rheologically contrasting magmas and explain deviations of the hybrid compositions from the theoretical mixed chemical composition. In particular, hybrid whole-rock compositions show non-linear correlations in inter-element variation diagrams for elements that are enriched or depleted in preferentially transferred crystals. This effect has been quantified by extending magma mixing modelling to include crystal transfer. The composite dykes studied could be regarded as scale models of the behaviour of larger-scale magmatic systems, so this investigation has important implications for interpreting the petrogenesis of igneous suites by magma mixing.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000339951000004	J	"Rams, Susana; Werner, Olaf; Ros, Rosa M."

The Sierra Nevada, which occupies around 2000 km(2), is the southernmost mountain range in continental Europe. It has a wide diversity of habitats due to its range of altitude, a variable landscape, geological substrata and soil, hydrological resources, climate, etc. It is therefore of great botanical interest within the Mediterranean Region. A total of 395 taxa are currently accepted in the area: 2 Anthocerophyta, 69 Marchantiophyta and 324 Bryophyta (excluding infraspecific taxa, there are 2 species of hornworts, 68 species of liverworts and 309 species of mosses). The total number of species represents 21.8% of the European, 24.2% of the Mediterranean and 35.3% of the Iberian bryoflora. In addition, a total of 35 taxa are considered to be doubtfully present in the area, and 34 are excluded from the final list. Among the accepted species, three are included in the category of Critically Endangered in the Spanish Red List of threatened bryophytes, one is Endangered, 19 are Vulnerable, and one is considered Extinct in the studied area. The main threats for bryophytes in the area are analyzed. The original material of Bryum perremotifolium Ther., from the Sierra Nevada, is lectotypified and reidentified as Bryum schleicheri.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1290-0796	1776-0992		WOS:000340229300003	J	"Oster, Jessica L.; Montanez, Isabel P.; Mertz-Kraus, Regina; Sharp, Warren D.; Stock, Greg M.; Spero, Howard J.; Tinsley, John; Zachos, James C."

We document changes in precipitation along the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada during early Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages (MIS) 3 and 4 (55-67 ka) from a U-series dated speleothem record from McLean's Cave. The timing of our multi-proxy geochemical dataset is coeval with D-O interstadials (15-18) and stadials, including Heinrich Event 6. The McLean's Cave stalagmite indicates warmer and drier conditions during Greenland interstadials (GISs 15-18), signified by elevated delta O-18, delta C-13, reflectance, and trace element concentrations, and less radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-88. Our record extends evidence of a strong linkage between high-latitude warming and reduced precipitation in western North America to early MIS 3 and MIS 4. This record shows that the linkage persists in diverse global climate states, and documents the nature of the climatic response in central California to Heinrich Event 6.

High mountain freshwater presents high variability of nutrients and chemico-physical parameters, showing variations of pH, oxygen concentration, metals and temperature throughout the year. National Park of Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) (37 degrees 032 N 03 degrees 182 W), has almost 40 lakes that are reported to be both endemic and oligotrophic. However, very little information about their microbial diversity can be found in literature. In this work, a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to find best nutritional conditions for the isolation of psychrophilic microalgae from La Caldera Lake. The results showed that best culture medium, was the Rodriguez-Lopez medium. (RL); data were adjusted to a quadratic prediction model reporting a biomass concentration over 600 mg/L at 10 and 20 degrees C. In this paper, the diversity of culturable freshwater microalgae in the La Caldera Lake was observed by PCR using specific primers for eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes. Samples were taken in early July and late Agust, 2011. In July presence of strains belonging to the Eustigmatophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. In August, only microalgae from the Eustigmatophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. An individual culture of each isolated strain was carried out. Microalgae S21 had phylogenetic similitude with Chlorophyceae, and showed best growth being biomass concentration in RL 393.73 mg/L and 128.52 mg/L at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, specific growth rates (mu(max)), 0.25/h and 0.13/h at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, respectively, were detected for strain S21."									0	0	0	0	0	0			1735-6865	2008-2304		WOS:000339932500029	J	"Gomez-Gutierrez, Alvaro; Juan de Sanjose-Blasco, Jose; de Matias-Bejarano, Javier; Berenguer-Sempere, Fernando"				Rubio Delgado, Judit/N-2195-2014	Rubio Delgado, Judit/0000-0001-9791-1035			Comparing Two Photo-Reconstruction Methods to Produce High Density Point Clouds and DEMs in the Corral del Veleta Rock Glacier (Sierra Nevada, Spain)								REMOTE SENSING				6	6			5407	5427		10.3390/rs6065407			Jun-14	2014	In this paper, two methods based on computer vision are presented in order to produce dense point clouds and high resolution DEMs (digital elevation models) of the Corral del Veleta rock glacier in Sierra Nevada (Spain). The first one is a semi-automatic 3D photo-reconstruction method (SA-3D-PR) based on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform algorithm and the epipolar geometry theory that uses oblique photographs and camera calibration parameters as input. The second method is fully automatic (FA-3D-PR) and is based on the recently released software 123D-Catch that uses the Structure from Motion and MultiView Stereo algorithms and needs as input oblique photographs and some measurements in order to scale and geo-reference the resulting model. The accuracy of the models was tested using as benchmark a 3D model registered by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The results indicate that both methods can be applied to micro-scale study of rock glacier morphologies and processes with average distances to the TLS point cloud of 0.28 m and 0.21 m, for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. The performance of the models was also tested by means of the dimensionless relative precision ratio parameter resulting in figures of 1:1071 and 1:1429 for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. Finally, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area were produced and compared with the TLS-derived DEM. The results showed average absolute differences with the TLS-derived DEM of 0.52 m and 0.51 m for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2072-4292			WOS:000338763300033	J	"Biber, Jani Leyla; McCann, Tom"								Peperite development in a Miocene-age carbonate succession, Cabo de Gata volcanic area (Agua Amarga/Carboneras basins), SE Spain - The Breche Rouge revisited								ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN				165	2			229	245		10.1127/1860-1804/2014/0064			Jun-14	2014	The Miocene-age Agua Amarga and Carboneras basins, SE Spain, contain an unusual lithological assemblage, termed the Breche Rouge, and comprising fractured andesitic cryptodomes, associated breccias and a fossil-rich volcaniclastic conglomerate and related calcarenite. The cryptodomes are crisscrossed by a series of fractures and veins infilled with brecciated material, the clasts of which often show well-preserved jigsaw textures, as well as evidence of fluidal and sub-planar margins. Surrounding the breccia clasts were three different matrix types, namely a red floatstone/rudstone containing fossils (predominantly solitary corals), as well as pink and orange mudstones. Together, these lithologies are interpreted as resulting from in-situ peperitisation at the top of the cryptodomes and related mass flows, generated as a result of volcanic activity in a submarine setting.The evolution of the succession can be explained in terms of a two-stage model. Stage 1 (pre-Carboneras volcanic stage) comprised the deposition of calcarenites, often interbedded with volcaniclastics and possible bentonites. The volcanic products were derived from the S, SE and E, although it is possible that some of the material was also derived from areas to the N of the Carboneras region. Stage 2 (Carboneras volcanic stage) was characterised by volcanic activity forming massive andesites, and the related intrusion of the andesites into wet and/or unconsolidated carbonate sediments resulting in peperite development. In the Carboneras area mass flows were generated and flowed southwards into the Agua Amarga Basin.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1860-1804			WOS:000338489200010	J	"Magdaleno, F.; Blanco-Garrido, F.; Bonada, N.; Herrera-Grao, T."								How are riparian plants distributed along the riverbank topographic gradient in Mediterranean rivers? Application to minimally altered river stretches in Southern Spain								LIMNETICA				33	1			121	137					Jun-14	2014	Species structure and composition in Mediterranean riparian forests are determined by hydrological features, longitudinal zonation, and riverbank topography. This study assesses the distribution of four native riparian plants along the riverbank topographic gradient in three river stretches in southern Spain, with special emphasis on the occupation of adult and young feet of each species. The studied stretches suffered minimal human disturbances, displayed semi-arid conditions, and had wide riparian areas to allow the development of the target species: black alder (Alnus glutinosa), salvia leaf willow (Salix salviifolia), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and oleander (Nerium oleander). Thalweg height was used to define the riverbank topographic gradient. The results showed a preferential zone for black alder and salvia leaf willow in the range of 0-150 cm from the channel thalweg, with adult alders and willows being more common between 51 and 150 cm and young alders being more common under 50 cm. Conversely, narrow-leafed ash and oleander were much more frequent, and showed greater development, in the ranges of 151-200 cm and 201-250 cm, respectively, whereas the young feet of both species covered the entire topographic range. Adult feet of the four species were spatially segregated along the riverbank topographic gradient, indicating their differential ability to cope with water stress from the non-tolerant alders and willows to more tolerant narrow-leafed ash trees and oleanders. Young feet, however, showed a strategy more closely linked to the initial availability of colonisation sites within riparian areas to the dispersion strategy of each species and to the distribution of adult feet. In Mediterranean areas, where riparian management has traditionally faced great challenges, the incorporation of species preferences along riverbank gradients could improve the performance of restoration projects.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0213-8409	1989-1806		WOS:000338003400010	J	"Reguera, Senda; Zamora-Camacho, Francisco J.; Trenzado, Cristina E.; Sanz, Ana; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio"				"Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/K-7068-2014; "	"Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/0000-0002-6726-7215; Trenzado Romero, Cristina Elena/0000-0003-4347-6108; REGUERA PANIZO, SENDA/0000-0002-3867-9210"			Oxidative stress decreases with elevation in the lizard Psammodromus algirus								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				172				52	56		10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.02.018			Jun-14	2014	Oxidative stress is considered one of the main ecological and evolutionary forces. Several environmental stressors vary geographically and thus organisms inhabiting different sites face different oxidant environments. Nevertheless, there is scarce information about how oxidative damage and antioxidant defences vary geographically in animals. Here we study how oxidative stress varies from lowlands (300-700 m asl) to highlands (2200-2500 m asl) in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. To accomplish this, antioxidant enzymatic activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, DT-diaphorase) and lipid peroxidation were assayed in tissue samples from the lizards' tail. Lipid peroxidation was higher in individuals from lowlands than from highlands, indicating higher oxidative stress in lowland lizards. These results suggest that environmental conditions are less oxidant at high elevations with respect to low ones. Therefore, our study shows that oxidative stress varies geographically, which should have important consequences for our understanding of geographic variation in physiology and life-history of organisms.

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe.LocationSouth-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain).MethodsWe compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits.ResultsWe found up-slope range shifts for 63% and 90% of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts were consistent with the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods.Main conclusionsThe differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the biogeography of the mountain and the species pool under study when assessing the sensitivity of species to future climate change in mountain regions.									9	0	0	8	0	9			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000334160200004	J	"Jimenez-Espejo, F.

Previous Saharan dust input reconstructions have been mainly based on marine records from the African margin, nevertheless dust reaching western-central Europe is mainly transported by high-altitude atmospheric currents and requires high altitude records for its reconstruction. The organic and inorganic geochemical study of sediments from a southern Iberia alpine lacustrine record has provided an exceptional reconstruction of Saharan dust impact and regional climatic variations during the Holocene. After the last deglaciation, results indicate that Saharan dust reached Western Europe in a stepwise fashion from 7.0 to 6.0 cal. kyr BP and increased since then until present, promoting major geochemical changes in the lacustrine system. Effective humidity reconstruction indicates wetter conditions during the early Holocene and progressive aridification during middle-late Holocene time, boosting abrupt changes in the lacustrine system. Cyclostratigraphic analyses and transport mechanisms both point to solar irradiance and aridity as major triggering factors for dust supply over Western Europe during the Holocene.

Annual displacement rates were lower than 1 cm yr(-1) both in northern and southern slopes. Solifluction was more active near snow patches and streams. Rates were also higher during snowier years.

In the present.study, a collection of strains nodulating this legume was analysed in characteristic soils of this ecosystem. Most strains nodulating G. versicolor belonged to rrs group I within the genus Bradyrhizobium and only one strain, named GV137, belonged to rrs group II from which only a single species, B. retamae, has been described in Europe to date. Strain GV137, and some strains from rrs group I, belonged to putative new species of Bradyrhizobium, although most strains from group I belonged to B. canariense, according to the ITS fragment and atpD gene analysis. This result contrasted with those obtained in Genista tinctoria in Northeast Europe whose endosymbionts were identified as B. japonicum. The analysis of the symbiotic nodC and nifH genes carried by G. versicolor-nodulating strains showed that most of them belonged to symbiovar genistearum, as did those isolated from G. tinctoria. Nevertheless, strain GV137, belonging to rrs group II, formed a divergent lineage that constituted a novel symbiovar within the genus Bradyrhizobium for which the name sierranevadense is proposed. This finding showed that the Genisteae are not restrictive legumes only nodulated by symbiovar genistearum, since Genista is a promiscuous legume nodulated by at least two symbiovars of Bradyrhizobium, as occurs in Retama species.

Regarding altitude, the most influential variables on organisms are temperature and ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, the first decreasing and the second increasing with altitude. Both variables affect ectotherms' biology, as ectotherms depend on environmental temperature for thermoregulation, frequently being heliotherms. Here, we studied dorsal coloration in the lizard Psammodromus algirus (Linnaeus, 1758) along a wide altitudinal gradient (2200 m) in Sierra Nevada (south-east Spain). We hypothesize that the skin will be darker with altitude, i.e. in environments with lower temperatures and higher UV radiation intensity. Results show that individual dorsal colorations became darker at high altitude. We propose two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this result: (1) darker dorsal surface would favour faster warming at high altitudes, where temperature is lower, and (2) darker dorsal surface would protect against UV radiation, stronger at high altitudes. We found significant relationships between both temperature and UV radiation and population dorsal darkness, giving mixed support for the two explanations. Moreover, dorsal hue was positively correlated with substrate hue, suggesting that hue evolved to maximize crypsis. Our study therefore suggests that geographical variation in dorsal coloration in this lizard is adaptive, and darkness coloration might have evolved in response to adverse conditions (low temperature and high UV radiation) at high altitudes.

Young songbirds that settle to breed outside their natal song-dialect area may learn to produce nonnatal dialect by hearing and memorizing these songs during juvenile dispersal. We quantified adult singing rates in a population of Mountain White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) in the Sierra Nevada in 2 yr, and compared them with the arrival schedule of juveniles not hatched on the study area. Our results show that opportunities for juveniles to learn new (nonnatal) song types become highly limited during the premigratory dispersal phase, because adult singing rates are very low by the time nonlocal juveniles begin to arrive. Thus, if individuals learn nonnatal songs during dispersal, they must do so hearing relatively few repetitions of the unfamiliar dialect.									1	0	0	0	0	1			Apr-38	1938-4254		WOS:000336477300009	J	"Arias, Maria Sol; Moreno, Virginia; Sarasa, Mathieu; Paz-Silva, Adolfo; Sanchez-Andrade, Rita; Morrondo, Patrocinio; Diez-Banos, Pablo; Granados, Jose E.; Sanchezjj, Antonio; Perez, Jeusus M."

To date, both the diagnosis of oestrosis and the determination of the intensity of parasitism require the use of invasive methods (necropsy), which necessarily limit research possibilities. We analyzed the immune humoral response (IgM and IgG) against Oestrus ovis L. excretory/secretory larval antigens in 32 sera taken from Iberian ibex from the Sierra Nevada Natural Space (southern Spain). Three antigens were collected: L1OES (from L1 larvae), L2OES (L2), and L3OES (L3). Necropsy was considered as the gold standard. The percentage of ibexes harboring Oestrus spp. larvae was 88%, the mean intensity of parasitism being 16.96 +/- 14.96 larvae per parasitized host (range: 2-52). In our sample, first-instar larvae (L1) were found in 9% of ibexes, while 69% of hosts carried L2 larvae and 88% L3 larvae. Positive correlations between L1 and L2 numbers, and between L2 and L3 numbers were detected. The best results with the immunoenzymatic assay were obtained using IgG antibodies against the L1OES antigens (specificity = 89%; sensitivity = 100%; positive predictive value = 100%; negative predictive value = 57%). The IgG seroprevalence against L1OES was 78%. Thus, the analysis of IgG antibodies against antigens collected from L1 O. ovis larvae would seem to be a noninvasive method for reliably diagnosing oestrosis in naturally infested Iberian ibex. Nevertheless, additional immunological and methodological advances are still required because false positive and false negative results still represent a non-negligible part of the results of the ELISA tests."									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3395	1937-2345		WOS:000335385800010	24299554J	"Olive, Marc; Gomez Ortiz, Antonio; Palacios Estremera, David; Salvador Franch, Ferran; Salva Catarineu, Monserrat"								THE QUATERNARY IN THE MASSIF OF THE SIERRA NEVADA.

Particularly significant are the progress made in the Sierra Nevada massif, in the southern peninsular. In this case, researchers have used natural records and documentary sources to reconstruct the environmental dynamics from the last glaciation and subsequent deglaciation of the massif to their recent evolution. Detected environmental changes can induce climate variability during the past millennia. The impact of human activity on the peaks of the Sierra Nevada has been significant for the upper Holocene, particularly from the Muslim occupation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1138-9788			WOS:000334901400001	J	"Miguel Barea-Azcon, Jose; Benito, Blas M.; Olivares, Francisco J.; Ruiz, Helena; Martin, Javier; Garcia, Antonio L.; Lopez, Rogelio"								Distribution and conservation of the relict interaction between the butterfly Agriades zullichi and its larval foodplant (Androsace vitaliana nevadensis)								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				23	4			927	944		10.1007/s10531-014-0643-4			Apr-14	2014	Although Mediterranean mountains are considered biodiversity hot-spots, the presence of relict biotic interactions as a testimony of a past colder climate is an aspect frequently missed. Herein we investigate the distribution and conservation problems of a relict interaction in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southern Europe) between the butterfly Agriades zullichi-a rare and threatened butterfly-and its larval foodplant Androsace vitaliana subsp. nevadensis. We designed an intensive field survey to obtain a comprehensive presence dataset. This was used to calibrate species distribution models with absences taken at local and regional extents, analyze the potential distribution, evaluate the influence of environmental factors in different geographical contexts, and evaluate conservation threats for both organisms. We found 39 presence localities inhabited by the larval foodplant and the butterfly comprising 60.93 ha, with 82 % of the area concentrated in ten larger localities. The local and regional distribution models explained 68.7 and 85.0 % deviance, indicating a suitable area of 1,884.8 and 9,621.22 ha respectively. Topography and soil properties were the most important variables in the local model and temperature in the regional model. We observed several threats such as restricted extent of occurrence, lack of larval foodplant regeneration, the negative effect of the ski resort and a potential high sensitivity to climate change. Finally, we recommend some management measures in order to improve the conservation of key populations of both species, reinforcing A. vitaliana nevadensis populations and researching the importance of phenology in the persistence of this interaction under climate change.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000332739300008	J	"Schoeb, Christian; Prieto, Ivan; Armas, Cristina; Pugnaire, Francisco I."

Facilitation is known as the positive effect of one species (benefactor) on associated neighbouring species (beneficiaries). Although the beneficial part of this interaction has received considerable research interest, there is a gap of knowledge on the bidirectional nature of these interactions; in particular, the physiological and fitness consequences for both beneficiaries and benefactors.2. Alpine cushion plants are generally strong benefactors, increasing species richness and abundance on a global scale, and provide a suitable system to study the physiological effects of bidirectional interactions and its consequences for reproduction. Current knowledge suggests that species improve their fitness when associated to a benefactor cushion species, whereas cushions may receive predominantly negative feedbacks.3. We measured physiological and reproductive traits of the cushion species Arenaria tetraquetra ssp. amabilis and three other forbs (Eryngium glaciale, Lotus corniculatus ssp. glacialis and Plantago nivalis) in the dry Sierra Nevada Mountains, southern Spain. All four species were studied either when growing alone or when the three forbs were associated with the cushion plant.4. The three forb species improved their water status when associated with the cushion, and Lotus and Plantago significantly increased their seed set. In contrast, Arenaria showed poorer water status and reduced flower density and seed set with increasing cover of beneficiary species. There was a clear relationship between physiological and reproductive traits in Arenaria growing without beneficiaries but not in Arenaria with beneficiaries. Control cushions (without beneficiary species) showed increased seed set and seed mass with increasing photosynthetic and water use efficiencies, respectively, the latter being positively related to leaf nitrogen content. In contrast, cushions with a large cover of beneficiary species did not show such relations. The missing relationship between physiological and reproductive traits for these facilitating cushions indicates that reproductive output in heavily colonized cushions may not be directly related to the plant physiological status and the availability of resources.5. Our results revealed the antagonistic behaviour underlying the interaction between beneficiary species and facilitating cushion plants, similar to parasitic interactions. They also provide indications for changes in cushions' resource allocation pattern in response to colonization by beneficiaries."									5	0	0	5	0	5			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000332777500023	J	"Finn, Debra S.; Zamora-Munoz, Carmen; Murria, Cesc; Sainz-Bariain, Marta; Alba-Tercedor, Javier"				"Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/K-7050-2014; Murria, Cesc/L-4620-2013"	"Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/0000-0002-3037-1529; Murria, Cesc/0000-0003-4319-0804"			Evidence from recently deglaciated mountain ranges that Baetis alpinus (Ephemeroptera) could lose significant genetic diversity as alpine glaciers disappear								FRESHWATER SCIENCE				33	1			207	216		10.1086/674361			Mar-14	2014	Climate change will cause relict alpine glaciers to disappear within decades. Associated high-altitude streams will face significant hydrological changes that might affect population genetic diversity of lotic species. In a recent study of glacier-fed streams in the Pyrenees, Finn et al. (2013) predicted that a large proportion of regional genetic diversity of the mayfly Baetis alpinus would be lost as glacial meltwater sources disappear. We expanded the analysis of Finn et al. to include genetic data (mitochondrial barcoding region) collected from B. alpinus occupying recently deglaciated locations including multiple basins in 2 mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa) on the Iberian Peninsula and 1 additional, deglaciated Pyrenean basin. We hypothesized that regional genetic diversity at scales of entire mountain ranges (gamma diversity) and population structure within ranges (beta diversity) would be lower in recently deglaciated mountain ranges than in the still-glaciated Pyrenees. For 4 cryptic lineages of the B. alpinus species complex in 3 mountain ranges, we found significantly lower genetic diversity in recently deglaciated than glaciated regions. beta and gamma genetic diversity were correlated, suggesting that population structure (beta) strongly influences total regional diversity. Results support the hypothesis of Finn et al. (2013) that disappearance of alpine glaciers will result in substantial loss of genetic diversity. The distinctive hydrological environment created by glacial meltwater might drive an interaction between reproductive barriers (between highly and minimally glacier-influenced reaches within basins) and physical barriers (isolating highly glacier-influenced reaches									3	0	0	3	0	3			2161-9549	2161-9565		WOS:000332322400019	J	"Aranbarri, Josu K.; Gonzalez-Samperiz, Penelope; Valero-Garces, Bias; Moreno, Ana; Gil-Romera, Graciela; Sevilla-Callejo, Miguel; Garcia-Prieto, Eduardo; Di Rita, Federico; Mata, M.

The Lateglacial and early Holocene periods are characterized by arid conditions with a stable landscape dominated by pinewoods and steppe until ca. 7780 cal yr BP, despite sedimentological evidence for large paleohydrological fluctuations in the paleolake. The most humid phase occurred between ca. 7780 and 5000 cal yr BP and was characterized by the maximum spread of mesophytes (e.g., Betula, Coorlus, Quercus faginea type), the expansion of a mixed Mediterranean oak woodland with evergreen Quercus as dominant forest communities and more frequent higher lake level periods. The return of a dense pinewood synchronous with the depletion of mesophytes characterizes the mid-late Holocene transition (ca. 5000 cal yr BP) most likely as a consequence of an increasing aridity that coincides with the reappearance of a shallow, carbonate wetland environment. The paleohydrological and vegetation evolution shows similarities with other continental Mediterranean areas of Iberia and demonstrates a marked resilience of terrestrial vegetation and gradual responses to millennialscale climate fluctuations. Human impact is negligible until the lbero-Roman period (ca. 2500 cal yr BP) when a major deforestation occurred in the nearby pine forest. The last 1500 years are characterized by increasing landscape management, mainly associated with grazing practices shaping the current landscape. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the mechanisms controlling the variations of fluvial water and sediment discharge for the Ebro drainage basin, Spain, we apply a hydrological model HydroTrend. Comparison of model results with a 47-year observational record (AD 19531999) suggests that the model adequately captures annual average water discharge (simulated 408 m(3) s(-1) versus observed 425 m3 s-1) and sediment load (simulated 03 Mt yr(-1) versus observed 0.28 +/- 0.04 Mt yr(-1)) for the Ebro basin. A long-term (4000-year) simulation, driven by paleoclimate and anthropogenic land cover change scenarios, indicates that water discharge is controlled by the changes in precipitation, which has a high annual variability but no long-term trend. Modeled suspended sediment load, however, has an increasing trend overtime, which is closely related to anthropogenic land cover variations with no significant correlation to climatic changes. The simulation suggests that 4000 years ago the annual sediment load to the ocean was 30.5 Mt yr(-1), which increased over time to 47.2 Mt yr(-1) (AD 1860-1960). In the second half of the 20th century, the emplacement of large dams resulted in a dramatic decrease in suspended sediment discharge, eventually reducing the flux to the ocean by more than 99% (mean value changes from 38.1 Mt yr(-1) to 03 Mt yr(-1)).

Basal area increment (BAI) was measured in severely defoliated and non-defoliated trees, for a period of 20 years, a period that includes three severe droughts and two severe outbreaks of pine processionary moth. Linear mixed-effects models of BAI as a function of climate were run for non-defoliated trees and thereafter the fit of the model was tested separately both for defoliated and non-defoliated ones. Severely defoliated trees showed pronounced growth reductions during defoliation, although their cumulative basal area and drought-sensitivity were similar to those of non-defoliated trees. The results were not related to tree size or age, while non-climatic residuals were significantly related to the defoliation percentage. The combined effect of drought stress and processionary caterpillar defoliation caused short-term growth reduction in affected trees, although defoliated trees presented higher growth recovery after the defoliation, displaying similar average growth. We conclude that, in Scots pine, the growth reduction induced by processionary caterpillar defoliation can be overcome to a greater extent than the impact of drought. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We propose that it is time to address the problem of storing, documenting, and executing ecological models and analytical procedures. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to design and implement a web application that will help to meet this challenge. This tool will foster cooperation among scientists, enhancing the creation of relevant knowledge that could be transferred to environmental managers. We have implemented this conceptual framework in a tool called ModeleR. This is being used to document, share, and execute more than 200 models and analytical processes associated with a global change monitoring program that is being undertaken in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south Spain). ModeleR uses the concept of scientific workflow to connect and execute different types of models and analytical processes. Finally, we have envisioned the creation of a federation of model repositories where models documented within a local repository could be linked and even executed by other researchers.

Most papers on the relationships between taxa and area adopt the species-level approach. By contrast, our approach exports these concepts to other organizational levels of biodiversity and analyses the community-area relationships in the Betic mountain ranges at 4 levels of syntaxonomical hierarchy. Our approach also aims at studying the diversity of communities in the same way as taxonomical diversity is studied. To evaluate the matching of data to the different models, we used the regression coefficient (R-2) and the corrected version of Akaike's information criterion (AICc). The highest altitude of a sierra was taken as a surrogate of habitat diversity. ""Syntaxonomical diversity"" was evaluated in a similar way to the taxonomical diversity of Clarke & Warwick.We have studied 94 associations (belonging to 42 alliances, 36 orders and 25 classes). The calculated indexes reveal higher regression coefficient between richness in syntaxa and the parameter under study (area and highest altitude) in a semi-log model than in a log-log model. Although the best correlation is obtained considering both variables, the patterns of richness exhibit a higher correspondence with altitude than with area. Results confirm very high regression coefficient between richness in syntaxa and in the quantity of the endemic flora present in each sierra. The higher the syntaxonomical level concerned, the higher the regression coefficient.The richness of the syntaxa exhibits patterns similar to those of the endemic flora: the most important sites are siliceous Sierra Nevada, Sierra de Las Nieves and Sierra de Gador.

In this study, we identified hotspots at two scales of analysis within the Mediterranean overall hotspot. Particularly, based on the distribution of endemic-vascular-plant richness (EVPR), we identified micro-hotspots, among the richest floristic territories of the Sardinian and Baetic regions, and nano-hotspots, among the richest 1-km(2) grid cells of Sierra Nevada and Gennargentu massifs, located within these regions. In addition, we explored environmental drivers of EVPR, performing both simple- and multiple-regression models. Our results showed that even in areas previously defined as hotspots, the endemic-plant richness was not uniformly distributed, but rather depended largely on environmental conditions. Relationships between environmental drivers and EVPR have been poorly studied in the Mediterranean context, where we found patterns consistent among scales and regions. Specifically, EVPR was positively linked to altitude and precipitation, particularly in the driest period. Hence, the different levels of hotspots nested in hotspots were organized in a hierarchy. This downscaling approach may help to focus conservation efforts within a given hotspot, e.g. the identification of narrow hotspots could be useful to find gaps in the protected-area networks. Specifically, the identified nano-hotspots are certainly priority sites for plant conservation, since the whole of the nano-hotspots in each region represented less than 1% of the surface area but contained more than 19% of the regional EVPR. Moreover, an examination of both where hotspots are and under what environmental conditions they appear, would enable the detection of specific threats. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested several of their cornerstone hypotheses by measuring the nucleic acid (NA) and phosphorus (P) content of crustacean zooplankton species in 22 high mountain lakes (Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees mountains, Spain). The P-allocation hypothesis (PAH) proposes that the genome size is smaller in cladocerans than in copepods as a result of selection for fast growth towards P-allocation from DNA to RNA under P limitation. Consistent with the PAH, the RNA: DNA ratio was >8-fold higher in cladocerans than in copepods, although 'fast-growth' cladocerans did not always exhibit higher RNA and lower DNA contents in comparison to 'slow-growth' copepods. We also showed strong associations among growth rate, RNA, and total P content supporting the growth rate hypothesis, which predicts that fast-growing organisms have high P content because of the preferential allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA. In addition, we found that ontogenetic variability in NA content of the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus (intra-and interstage variability) was comparable to the interspecific variability across other zooplankton species. Further, according to the metabolic theory of ecology, temperature should enhance growth rate and hence RNA demands. RNA content in zooplankton was correlated with temperature, but the relationships were nutrient-dependent, with a positive correlation in nutrient-rich ecosystems and a negative one in those with scarce nutrients. Overall our results illustrate the mechanistic connections among organismal NA content, growth rate, nutrients and temperature, contributing to the conceptual unification of metabolic and stoichiometric theories.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			ZOOREC:ZOOR15009043056	J	"Jose Bullejos, Francisco; Carrillo, Presentacion; Gorokhova, Elena; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel"				"Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; "	Gorokhova, Elena/0000-0002-4192-6956			Nucleic Acid Content in Crustacean Zooplankton: Bridging Metabolic and Stoichiometric Predictions								PLOS ONE				9	1					e86493	10.1371/journal.pone.0086493			JAN 21 2014	2014	Metabolic and stoichiometric theories of ecology have provided broad complementary principles to understand ecosystem processes across different levels of biological organization.

Further, according to the metabolic theory of ecology, temperature should enhance growth rate and hence RNA demands. RNA content in zooplankton was correlated with temperature, but the relationships were nutrient-dependent, with a positive correlation in nutrient-rich ecosystems and a negative one in those with scarce nutrients. Overall our results illustrate the mechanistic connections among organismal NA content, growth rate, nutrients and temperature, contributing to the conceptual unification of metabolic and stoichiometric theories.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000330244500247	24466118J	"Leverkus, Alexandro B.; Lorite, Juan; Navarro, Francisco B.; Sanchez-Canete, Enrique P.; Castro, Jorge"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014; Navarro, Francisco/M-2882-2014; Sanchez-Canete, Enrique/I-3615-2014"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240; Navarro, Francisco/0000-0001-8782-6873; Sanchez-Canete, Enrique/0000-0003-0482-6726"			Post-fire salvage logging alters species composition and reduces cover, richness, and diversity in Mediterranean plant communities								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				133				323	331		10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.12.014			JAN 15 2014	2014	"An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity, cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of intervention: ""Non-Intervention"" (all trees left standing), ""Partial Cut plus Lopping"" (felling 90% of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and ""Salvage Logging"" (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species assemblages and 25% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities. Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species, which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

The central Betic Cordillera (southern Spain) is affected by moderately active tectonic structures and seismicity. Part of this seismic activity is produced by several NW-SE normal faults located in the E of the Granada Basin.Here, we apply Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) data to quantify the deformation produced by the Granada fault and the Padul fault zones and the surrounding area. The Granada NW-SE active normal fault zone, 17 km in length, crosses the city of Granada, a very sensitive area from a seismic hazard point of view due to the population of the Granada town. At the Padul fault, there is no geodetic evidence of contemporary motion. Considering the evidence of recent activity from geologic data, this fault may experience discontinuous motion with a different seismogenic character. Despite the InSAR uncertainties, InSAR results are consistent with the estimated geologic deformation rates lower than 1 mm/yr. Our results also confirm previous InSAR studies in the Otura area showing an estimated average annual velocity along the SAR line-of-sight of up to 10 mm/year anthropogenic subsidence.

Seed germination after freezing in high-mountain plant species: Implications for ski-run restoration								PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				83				423	429					2014	2014	The construction of a ski slope implies a strong environmental impact as a result of the removal of the vegetation cover. The need to protect the soil requires a rapid restoration of vegetation, which is often done with commercial seed mixtures that can cause a negative impact on these high mountain ecosystems. Thus, the use of seeds of native species is essential, especially in areas rich in endemic species. The compaction of snow as a result of the preparation of the ski slopes causes the soil to freeze. This hinders the germination of seeds, especially those of shrub species. This paper analyzes, under laboratory conditions, how freezing and phytohormone application affect the seed germination of three endemic shrubby species used in the restoration of the ski slopes on Sierra Nevada (S. Spain). Freezing considerably reduced the germination of all species. However, when seeds were previously subjected to phytohormones, the germination percentage increased up to 10-fold with respect to seeds not treated with growth regulators. The results suggest that treating seeds with phytohormones could improve the restoration of the ski slopes with native species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1851-5657			WOS:000349881600052	S	"Lopez, Gabriel; Javier Batlles, Francisco; Rossi, Fillipo"					Lopez Rodriguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-0117-6713	"Lentz, A; Renne, D"		Deriving solar radiation in a mountain area from MODIS information								2013 ISES SOLAR WORLD CONGRESS		Energy Procedia		57				1092	1099		10.1016/j.egypro.2014.10.095			2014	2014	Solar radiation has a direct influence on the air and ground temperature, indirect influence on the value of atmospheric humidity, movement of air masses and precipitations, and it is easy to understand how its evaluation is essential not only in the technological area such as for sizing solar heating and photovoltaic plants, but also in fields such as agriculture or meteorology. Nowadays, the assessment of the solar energy resources over large areas and the elaboration of solar radiation maps are conducted using satellite derived information. Among the existing methodologies, those based on parametric models to firstly estimate the clear-sky solar radiation are usual. The success of that option depends both on the accuracy of the solar radiation algorithm and the satellite derived information and on the relationship between each other.In this work, daily global solar irradiation under clear skies is estimated by means of a model which includes the horizon effects. This characteristic is important in those cases where a complex topography is present, such as mountains. The topographic information is obtained from a digital elevation model. The other inputs to the model are the atmospheric precipitable water vapour content, the Angstrm's turbidity coefficient and the ground albedo. Experimental values of the atmospheric precipitable water vapour content are obtained from the MODIS sensor. The two latter parameters are averaged values calculated on previous studies.Estimates by the model are compared with ground measurements obtained in fourteen radiometric stations located in a mountain zone (Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain) recording global solar radiation, atmospheric temperature and relative humidity. Since ground experimental values of precipitable water vapour content are available, a comparison between these values and those derived from the MODIS sensor is also presented. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This cirque was the source of a glacier valley during the Quaternary cold periods. During the Little Ice Age it sheltered a small glacier, the most southerly in Europe, about which we have possessed written records since the 17th century. This glacier still had ice residues until the mid-20th century. This ice is no longer visible, but a residue persists along with discontinuous permafrost trapped under strata of rock blocks that make up an incipient rock glacier.From 2006 to 2013, this rock glacier was monitored by measurement of the temperature of the active layer, the degree of snow cover on the ground, movements of the body of the rock glacier and geophysical prospection inside it. The results show that the relict ice and trapped permafrost have been steadily declining. The processes that explain this degradation occur in chain, starting from the external radiation that affects the ground in summer, which is when the temperatures are higher. In effect, when this radiation steadily melts the snow on the ground, the thermal expansive wave advances into the heart of the active layer, reaching the ceiling of the frozen mass, which it then degrades and melts. In this entire linked process, the circulation of meltwaters ful-fils a highly significant function, as they act as heat transmitters. The complementary nature of these processes explains the subsidence and continuous changes in the entire clastic pack and the melting of the frozen ceiling on which it rests. This happens in summer in just a few weeks.All these events, in particular the geomorphological ones, take place on the Sierra Nevada peaks within certain climate conditions that are at present unfavourable to the maintenance of snow on the ground in summer. These conditions could be related to recent variations in the climate, starting in the mid-19th century and most markedly since the second half of the 20th century.The work and results highlight the climate sensitivity of the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to the effect of climate change and its impact on the dynamics of ecosystems, which is a benchmark for evaluating the current evolution of landscapes of Mediterranean high mountains.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1869-9510	1869-9529		WOS:000347545800029	S	"Lopez, Gabriel; Javier Batlles, Francisco"				"Lopez Rodriguez, Gabriel/N-2505-2014; "	Lopez Rodriguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-0117-6713	Pitchumani, R		Estimating solar radiation from MODIS data								PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOLARPACES 2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE		Energy Procedia		49				2362	2369		10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.250			2014	2014	"The assessment of the solar energy resources over large areas and the elaboration of solar radiation maps are nowdays conducted using satellite derived information.

The fungus produced spores in single species cultures, using Sorghum vulgare or Trifolium pratense as bait plant. The new species was named A. viridis because of its greenish appearance under the dissecting and in the compound microscope. The spores have a smooth surface and are similar in size to several other Acaulospora species, such as A. koskei, A. laevis, A. capsicula, A. colliculosa and A. entreriana. However, the new species can easily be distinguished from all these fungi by the diagnostic staining of the middle wall in Melzer's reagent. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences obtained from the ITS and partial LSU of the ribosomal genes confirm the new species in a clearly separate clade within the Acaulosporaceae.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0029-5035			WOS:000340334900006	J	"Jesus Perez-Luque, Antonio; Javier Bonet, Francisco; Perez-Perez, Ramon; Aspizua, Rut; Lorite, Juan; Zamora, Regino"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Perez-Luque, Antonio Jesus/J-8611-2015"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Perez-Luque, Antonio Jesus/0000-0002-1747-0469"			Sinfonevada: Dataset of Floristic diversity in Sierra Nevada forests (SE Spain)								PHYTOKEYS				35				1	15		10.3897/phytokeys.35.6363			2014	2014	The Sinfonevada database is a forest inventory that contains information on the forest ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain).

We recorded the number of eggs per ephippium collected in the traps and studied the zooplankton and phytoplankton communities as well as the nutrient conditions in the lake. Ephippia production was negatively correlated with the light phase of the photoperiod. Numerous empty ephippia were produced, and their number was negatively correlated with the epibiont burden of the chlorophyte Korshikoviella gracilipes on Daphnia. The number of healthy eggs per ephippium in the sediment traps was related to the edible phytoplankton biomass and/or epibiont burden. The proportion of empty ephippia was negatively related to the epibiont burden. These results suggest that the onset and rate of ephippia production is related to the photoperiod, and that the production of ephippial eggs per ephippium increases with greater food availability (phytoplankton biomass and/or epibiont burden). This is the first published evidence that food availability may favour resting egg reproduction under photoperiod conditions that trigger ephippia production.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000329906200014	J	"Zielinski, William J.; Thompson, Craig M.; Purcell, Kathryn L.; Garner, James D."								An assessment of fisher (Pekania pennanti) tolerance to forest management intensity on the landscape								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				310				821	826		10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.028			DEC 15 2013	2013	Forest restoration intended to reduce the overabundance of dense vegetation can be at odds with wildlife habitat conservation, particularly for species of wildlife that are strongly associated with structurally diverse forests with dense canopies. The fisher (Pekania pennanti), a mesopredator that occurs in mid-elevation forests of the southern Sierra Nevada, is such a species and managers are challenged to address fuel accumulations while at the same time maintaining sufficient habitat. We were interested in whether fishers tolerate the amount of management-related disturbance that fire ecologists predict will be sufficient to reduce the severity and spread rate of fires. To address this question we related an index of relative fisher abundance to data on the amount of each sample area that has been affected by one or more forms of disturbance. These are forms of forest management associated with either restoration activities (e.g., thinning, prescribed fire) or timber harvest (e.g., clear cutting, selection harvest). We used scat detection dogs to determine the relative abundance of scats in each of 15, 14 km(2) hexagonal sample areas that were sampled twice a year for 4 years. These data were used to classify each sample area as either low, moderate or high relative abundance of fishers. We also summarized for each of the sample areas the total number of hectares (including overlap) affected by management activities each year, and generated a 3-year running average. The areas exhibiting the highest use by fishers had an average of 36.7 hectares per year affected by ground-disturbing activities. Given that each sample area was 1400 hectares, this suggests that fishers consistently occupy at the highest rate of use places where an average of 2.6% of the area has been disturbed per year. This translates to an average of 7.4 ha of disturbance/year/km(2) (47.1 acres of disturbance/year/mi(2)). This is more disturbance than was predicted to be necessary to treat forests to reduce fire spread rate and severity in the southern Sierra Nevada, but less than predicted to be necessary by fire models for other geographic locations. Our work suggests that it may be possible to implement restorative treatments at an extent and rate that achieves fire modeling goals and does not affect occupancy by fishers. Implementation of such an approach, however, should also consider protection of large trees (conifers and hardwoods) used as resting and denning sites and account for the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

Phase 2 of the Distributed Model lntercomparison Project (DMIP 2) was formulated primarily as a mechanism to help guide the U.S. NWS as it expands its use of spatially distributed watershed models for operational river, flash flood, and water resources forecasting. The overall purpose of DMIP 2 was to test many distributed models forced by high quality operational data with a view towards meeting NWS operational forecasting needs. At the same time, DMIP 2 was formulated as an experiment that could be leveraged by the broader scientific community as a platform for the testing, evaluation, and improvement of distributed models.DMIP 2 contained experiments in two regions: in the DMIP 1 Oklahoma basins, and second, in two basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the western USA. This paper presents the overview and results of the DMIP 2 experiments conducted for the two Sierra Nevada basins. Simulations from five independent groups from France, Italy, Spain and the USA were analyzed. Experiments included comparison of lumped and distributed model streamflow simulations generated with uncalibrated and calibrated parameters, and simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at interior locations. As in other phases of DMIP, the participant simulations were evaluated against observed hourly streamflow and SWE data and compared with simulations provided by the NWS operational lumped model. A wide range of statistical measures are used to evaluate model performance on a run-period and event basis. Differences between uncalibrated and calibrated model simulations are assessed.Results indicate that in the two study basins, no single model performed best,in all cases. In addition, no distributed model was able to consistently outperform the lumped Model benchmark. However, one or more distributed models were able to outperform the lumped model benchmark in many of the analyses. Several calibrated distributed models achieved higher correlation and lower bias than the calibrated lumped benchmark in the calibration, validation, and combined periods. Evaluating a number of specific precipitation-runoff events, one calibrated distributed model was able to perform at a level equal to or better than the calibrated lumped model benchmark in terms of event-averaged peak and runoff volume error. However, three distributed models were able to provide improved peak timing compared to the lumped benchmark. Taken together, calibrated distributed models provided specific improvements over the lumped benchmark in 24% of the model-basin pairs for peak flow, 12% of the model-basin pairs for event runoff volume, and 41% of the model-basin pairs for peak timing. Model calibration improved the performance statistics of nearly all models (lumped and distributed). Analysis of several precipitation/runoff events indicates that distributed models may more accurately model the dynamics of the rain/snow line (and resulting hydrologic conditions) compared to the lumped benchmark model. Analysis of SWE simulations shows that better results were achieved at higher elevation observation sites.Although the performance of distributed models was mixed compared to the lumped benchmark, all calibrated models performed well compared to results in the DMIP 2 Oklahoma basins in terms of run period correlation and %Bias, and event-averaged peak and runoff error. This finding is noteworthy considering that these Sierra Nevada basins have complications such as orographically-enhanced precipitation, snow accumulation and melt, rain on snow events, and highly variable topography. Looking at these findings and those from the previous DMIP experiments, it is clear that at this point in their evolution, distributed models have the potential to provide valuable information on specific flood events that could complement lumped model simulations.

IMA fungus				4	2			243	9		10.5598/imafungus.2013.04.02.09			2013-Dec	2013	A new arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus was found in Sierra Nevada National Park of Andalucia (Southern Spain). It forms intraradical hyphae, vesicles and arbuscles, typical characteristics of Glomeromycetes. The spores are dark reddish brown to dark reddish black, 132-205 mum diam, and are formed on pigmented subtending hyphae whose pores are regularly closed by a thick septum at the spore base but without support of introverted wall thickening. Phylogenetic analyses on concatenate sequences of the partial SSU, ITS region and the partial LSU of the rDNA confirm the new species, described here as Septoglomus altomontanum, in a monophyletic clade next to S. africanum. An identification key to all Septoglomus species described is given. The new fungus can unequivocally be distinguished from all other Septoglomus species by the combination of spore size, colour and spore wall structure, and especially by the shape and colour of the subtending hyphae. Septoglomus altomontanum has so far been found only in soils with pH 5.9-6.7, located in mountainous and alpine altitudes (1800-3100 m asl) of Sierra Nevada which is well known for a high degree of plant endemism. While it is a frequent fungus in this area, it has so far not been found in lower altitudes in Andalucia.									6	0	0	6	0	6			2210-6340			MEDLINE:24563836	24563836J	"Kefauver, Shawn C.; Penuelas, Josep; Ustin, Susan"				"Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Kefauver, Shawn/D-7313-2014"	"Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Kefauver, Shawn/0000-0002-1687-1965"			Using topographic and remotely sensed variables to assess ozone injury to conifers in the Sierra Nevada (USA) and Catalonia (Spain)								REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT				139				138	148		10.1016/j.rse.2013.07.037			Dec-13	2013	The capacity to remotely identify impacts of ozone on conifers in California, USA and Catalonia, Spain was investigated using remote sensing and terrain-driven GIS analyses related to plant water relations and ozone uptake. The Ozone Injury Index (OII) field metric applied to Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi in the USA and adapted to Pinus uncinata in Spain included visible chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth. Species classifications of AVIRIS and CASI hyperspectral imagery all approached 80% overall accuracy for the target bioindicator species. Remote sensing vegetation indices correlated best with longer-wavelength SWIR indices from the AVIRIS data in California, with the exception of the Photosynthetic Reflectance Index (PRI) correlation with the 011 Visual Component (OIIVI), which was also the highest direct correlation in Catalonia. In Catalonia, the OIIVI alone and its subparts correlated better with the CASI data than with the full OIL namely the PRI (R-2 = 0.28, p = 0.0044 for OIIVI-amount and R-2 = 0.33 and p = 0.0016 for OIIVI-severity). Stepwise regression models of ozone injury developed using remote sensing indices combined with terrain-derived GIS variables were significant for OII in California (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.0001) and in Catalonia (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001 for OIIVI). Multiple regression models of ozone injury including a three year average of O-3 exposure were significant both with imaging spectroscopy indices alone (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and with topographic variables added (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001) in Catalonia. Applying the multivariate models to image classifications could provide useful maps useful for ozone impact monitoring but requires further validation before being considered operational.

Species-specific vulnerability to drought mortality may alter patterns of species diversity and affect future forest composition. We have explored the consequences of the extreme drought of 2005, which caused high sapling mortality (approx. 50 %) among 10-year-old saplings of two coexisting pine species in the Mediterranean mountains of Sierra Nevada (Spain): boreo-alpine Pinus sylvestris and Mediterranean P. nigra. Sapling height growth, leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18, and foliar nitrogen concentration in the four most recent leaf cohorts were measured in dead and surviving saplings. The foliar isotopic composition of dead saplings (which reflects time-integrated leaf gas-exchange until mortality) displayed sharp increases in both delta C-13 and delta O-18 during the extreme drought of 2005, suggesting an important role of stomatal conductance (g(s)) reduction and diffusional limitations to photosynthesis in mortality. While P. nigra showed decreased growth in 2005 compared to the previous wetter year, P. sylvestris maintained similar growth levels in both years. Decreased growth, coupled with a sharper increase in foliar delta O-18 during extreme drought in dead saplings, indicate a more conservative water use strategy for P. nigra. The different physiological behavior of the two pine species in response to drought (further supported by data from surviving saplings) may have influenced 2005 mortality rates, which contributed to 2.4-fold greater survival for P. nigra over the lifespan of the saplings. This species-specific vulnerability to extreme drought could lead to changes in dominance and distribution of pine species in Mediterranean mountain forests.									6	1	0	5	0	7			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000328210000041	23797412J	"Maranon-Jimenez, Sara; Castro, Jorge; Ignacio Querejeta, Jose; Fernandez-Ondono, Emilia; Allen, Craig D."

However, few studies have addressed the effects of different burnt-wood management options on seedling/sapling performance, or the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying differences among treatments. In this study, we experimentally assess the effects of post-fire management of the burnt wood on the growth and performance of naturally regenerating pine seedlings (Pinus pinaster). Three post-fire management treatments varying in degree of intervention were implemented seven months after a high-severity wildfire burned Mediterranean pine forests in the Sierra Nevada, southeast Spain: (a) ""No Intervention"" (NI, all burnt trees left standing); (b) ""Partial Cut plus Lopping"" (PCL, felling most of the burnt trees, cutting off branches, and leaving all the biomass on site without mastication); and (c) ""Salvage Logging"" (SL, felling the burnt trees, piling up the logs and masticating the fine woody debris). Three years after the fire, the growth, foliar nutrient concentrations, and leaf carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta N-15) of naturally regenerating seedlings were measured in all the treatments. Pine seedlings showed greatest vigor and size in the PCL treatment, whereas growth was poorest in SL. The nutrient concentrations were similar among treatments, although greater growth in the two treatments with residual wood present indicated higher plant uptake. Seedlings in the SL treatment showed high leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18 values indicating severe water stress, in contrast to significantly alleviated water stress indications in the PCL treatment. Seedling growth and physiological performance in NI was intermediate between that of PCL and SL After six growing seasons, P. pinaster saplings in PCL showed greater growth and cone production than SL saplings. In summary, salvage logging has a detrimental effect on the ecophysiological performance and growth of naturally regenerating pine seedlings, compared to alternative post-fire management practices in which burnt logs and branches are left in situ. Improved seedling growth and performance is associated with the amelioration of microsite/microclimate conditions by the presence of residual burnt wood, which alleviates seedling drought stress and improves nutrient availability through the decomposition of woody debris.

Averaging soil nutrient values and eliminating outliers from data sets can obscure important information about the nature and frequency of such hot spots. In this study, soil nutrient hot spots were investigated by sampling forest soils using resin-based methods to capture the effects of leaching and preferential flow followed by destructive O horizon and soil sampling including both nutrient and microbial analyses. Six by six-meter grids (16 grid points at 2-m intervals) were instrumented with UniBest (R) resin capsules and Western Ag Innovations PRS (TM) probes in sets of four per grid point at two sites. After the first precipitation event in the fall, two capsules and two probes were removed (referred to as ""event samples""), and the remaining two were left in place for the entire winter season and then removed in the following summer (referred to as ""season samples""). We hypothesized that hot spots (as indicated by statistical outliers and significant positive skew) would be more prevalent in the event samples than in the season samples because of greater importance of preferential flow during the first event. Data for the resin capsules supported this hypothesis, whereas data for the PRS probes did not. Calcium and Mg2+ values for season samples were significantly greater than those for event samples for both capsules and probes at both sites, as was expected because of the greater exposure to leaching in the season samples. Differences in event and season values for orthophosphate, NO3-, NH4+, and K+ varied, however, with some showing season > event, some no significant difference, and some event > season, suggesting a greater role of biological uptake in spring and perhaps the effect of cation exchange on resins. After the removal of the season resin samples, cores of O horizons and surface mineral soils were taken at each grid point and analyzed for total C and N, water-extractable nutrients, and microbial biomass (the latter in the mineral soil only by phospholipid fatty acid analysis). Correlations with microbial biomass measured via phospholipid fatty acid analysis were inconsistent. In summary, we found no consistent pattern of hot spots with season of sampling or microbial biomass. The seasonality of resin-based measurements suggested that ions of N and P were released mostly during the first precipitation event, whereas the reverse was true for Ca and Mg."									1	0	0	1	0	1			0038-075X	1538-9243		WOS:000335331200001	J	"Fernandez-Ramos, C.; Ballesteros, O.; Blanc, R.; Zafra-Gomez, A.; Camino-Sanchez, F.

The method involves the extraction of 5.00 g of dry sample with methanol using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 2-Octylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt (20C(8)-LAS) was used as internal standard. The analytical methods were applied to marine sediments collected from the coast of Almeria (South-east Spain) and river sediments collected from the Monachil river (Granada, South-east Spain). For AS homologues, the found limits of detection were 0.04-0.08 mu g g(-1) for marine and river sediments. For AES ethoxymers, the found limits of detection were 0.03-0.09 mu g g(-1) and 0.06-0.22 mu g g(-1) for marine and river sediments, respectively. The highest concentrations of AS and AES were found in river sediment samples. Significant differences were also observed between the behavior of short-chain compounds (C-12) and long-chain compounds (C-14 to C-18). The influence of the physic-chemical properties of water on the occurrence of these compounds was also evaluated, and differences between long- and short-chain compounds were also observed. Additionally, principal components analyses were carried out in order to study the relationship between variables and to evaluate the sources of data variability and behavior patterns. Finally, important conclusions were drawn regarding the environmental behavior of AS and AES. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Bryophyte species show wider distributions than vascular plants and include examples of truly cosmopolitan ranges, which have been interpreted as a result of high dispersal capacities and ecological plasticity. In the current study, we documented patterns of genetic structure and diversity in the cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum along an elevational gradient to determine if genetic diversity and structure is homogenized by intense migrations in the lack of ecological differentiation.Methods: 60 specimens were collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain) between 100 and 2870 m and sequenced for ITS and rps4. Comparative analyses, genetic diversity estimators, and Mantel's tests were employed to determine the relationship between genetic variation, elevation, and geographic distance and to look for signs of demographic shifts.Key results: Genetic diversity peaked above 1900 m and no signs of demographic shifts were detected at any elevation. There was a strong phylogenetic component in elevational variation. Genetic variation was signifi cantly correlated with elevation, but not with geographic distance.Conclusions: The results point to the long-term persistence of Bryum argenteum in a range that was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. Evidence for an environmentally driven pattern of genetic differentiation suggests adaptive divergence. This supports the Baas Becking tenet and indicates that ecological specialization might play a key role in explaining patterns of genetic structure in cosmopolitan mosses.									7	0	0	7	0	7			Feb-22	1537-2197		WOS:000325712800008	24091785J	"Achotegui-Castells, Ander; Llusia, Joan; Hodar, Jose A.; Penuelas, Josep"				Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011	Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150			Needle terpene concentrations and emissions of two coexisting subspecies of Scots pine attacked by the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa)								ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM				35	10			3047	3058		10.1007/s11738-013-1337-3			Oct-13	2013	"Mediterranean pine forests are often attacked by caterpillars of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lep., Thaumetopoidae), one of the most important defoliators in the Mediterranean region causing large economic losses and ecological effects. The needle terpene concentrations and emissions may play a key role in the defense of pines. We studied two subspecies of Pinus sylvestris, nevadensis (an endemic and relict subspecies) and iberica , with different levels of caterpillar attack in Sierra Nevada mountains (Spain). GC-MS analyses showed large total concentrations of terpenes (6 to 39 mg g(-1) of dry weight) in the needles of both subspecies under field conditions. Concentrations were 25 % higher in ""Non-Attacked Trees"" (NATs) of the iberica than in the nevadensis subspecies. The branches of NATs had terpene concentrations 20 % higher than those of ""Attacked Branches of attacked trees"" (ABs). Within attacked trees, the ""Non-Attacked Branches"" (NABs) also had terpene concentrations 20 % higher than those of ABs. Mainly alpha-pinene and germacrene D had higher concentrations in NATs and NABs than in ABs. Some terpenes had higher concentrations in NABs than in NATs, indicating possible systemic reactions. In subsp. nevadensis, the percentage of monoterpenes relative to total terpenes was higher in ABs than in other attack states. The rates of emission in nevadensis (standardized to 30 A degrees C) were ca. three times higher in ABs than in NABs and NATs. These results suggest that the lower terpene concentrations and high percentages of monoterpenes in ABs were produced by a combination of emission losses and terpene induction in response to herbivorous attack."									3	0	0	3	0	3			0137-5881			WOS:000324549000017	J	"Barrero, Alejandro F.; Mar Herrador del Pino, M.; Gonzalez Portero, Adriana; Arteaga Buron, Pilar; Arteaga, Jesus F.; Burillo Alquezar, Jesus; Elisa Diaz, Carmen; Gonzalez Coloma, Azucena"				"Arteaga, Jesus/K-8129-2014; Alejandro, Barrero/G-8243-2015"	"Arteaga, Jesus/0000-0001-8153-6621; Alejandro, Barrero/0000-0002-3058-8760"			Terpenes and polyacetylenes from cultivated Artemisia granatensis boiss (Royal chamomile) and their defensive properties								PHYTOCHEMISTRY				94				192	197		10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.04.002			Oct-13	2013	Artemisia granatensis, an endemic endangered plant species from Sierra Nevada (Spain) has been successfully cultivated in artificial systems (plants in artificial soil and transformed in vitro roots) to generate enough plant biomass (aerial and root) to allow for its chemical and biological study and at the same time to provide with methods for the sustainable production of the plant and its metabolites.

Genetic diversity measures of seven nuclear simple sequence repeat markers were compared, and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibria were tested to be originated from recent population demography. Results showed that, regardless of forest structure, the degree of clonality was very similar (similar to 60 %), being allele and lineage density proportional to stem density. Nevertheless, evenness of clonal distribution was higher in coppice, suggesting more homogeneous management than in open woodland. Contrary to previous beliefs, coppice stands do not involve genetic diversity losses; rather, the process of forest conversion into open woodland leads to the removal of numerous genetic lineages and low frequency alleles. The ancient presence of Q. pyrenaica in the region, which constituted quaternary glacial refuge, may contribute to its high genetic diversity. Historical vicissitudes in this anthropogenic deforested territory remark its resilient character; based on a specific fire pre-adaptive trait, continued coppicing fostered the preservation of its natural genetic diversity.

Noninvasive sampling is potentially a cost-effective and efficient means to monitor wild animals, thereby avoiding the need of capture and disturb species in the wild. On the basis of the morphological and genetic analyses of owl pellet contents, a so far undetected European snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) population was discovered in the Sierra Segura mountain range (Southern Spain). The mtDNA sequence from the newly discovered haplotype was compared with sequences from vole populations of the Sierra Nevada and Sierra Penalara mountain ranges (Spain) and from Churwalden (Switzerland). The nine recovered haplotypes clustered in four distinct lineages according to their geographical origin. The vole sequence from the Sierra Segura owl pellet belonged to a new haplotype, constituting a new lineage. The evolutionary divergence between sequences from the Sierra Segura and other Spanish populations was higher than that among other Spanish haplotypes. The new snow vole haplotype from this new locality duplicates the number of occurrence sites of this critically endangered species in Southern Spain, which is of great interest for further conservation and management plans of the European snow vole in the most southwestern area of its entire distribution range.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-1736	1940-1744		WOS:000324536500028	23521599J	"White, Angela M.; Zipkin, Elise F.; Manley, Patricia N.; Schlesinger, Matthew D."

In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Here, a mathematical model that encompasses all monoclinic and triclinic transpressional deformations including triclinic deformation with inclined simple shear (phi) and/or inclined extrusion orientations (nu) can be tested using a step-by-step approach with available field evidence. Two cases are presented. The first case from the Wabigoon-Quetico boundary in the Archean Superior Province utilizes both fabric orientation and quantified strain data. The best fit of the field evidence to the model indicates that deformation likely took place along subvertical shear zones via transpression with subhorizontal simple shear (phi = 0-20 degrees) and variable inclined extrusion direction (extrusion can be either east or west and v typically indicates extrusion orientations between 0 and 50 degrees from vertical). The second case of the South Iberian shear zone has fabric orientation data, but no quantifiable strain possibilities. The best fit of the field evidence to the model indicates that deformation likely took place along a moderately inclined shear zone via transpression with subhorizontal simple shear (phi = 0-20 degrees) and variable inclined extrusion direction (nu values between 0 degrees and 80 degrees from the true dip of the shear zone). Using this protocol in other examples of natural deformation will allow further constraints to be applied to kinematic models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Parasites & Vectors				6				1	5					Aug 22 2013	2013	Background: Wildlife radio tracking has gained popularity during the recent past. Ecologists and conservationists use radio-collars for different purposes: animal movement monitoring, home range, productivity, population estimation, behaviour, habitat use, survival, and predator-prey interaction, among others. The aim of our present study is to highlight the application of radio-collars for wildlife diseases monitoring. The spread of wildlife diseases and the efficacy of management actions for controlling them propose serious challenges for ecologists and conservationists, since it is difficult to re-capture (or simply observe) the same animal in pre-determined temporal interval, but such difficulty is overcome by the use of gps-gsm radio collars. Methods: In the present study we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the use of radio-collars in the monitoring of Iberian ibex affected by Sarcoptes scabiei in Sierra Nevada mountain range, Spain. Twenty-five moderate or slightly mangy animals were radio-collared between 2006 and 2013. Results: The radio-collars allowed us to confirm the presence of resistance to S. scabiei within Iberian ibex population. Twenty (80%) of the collared animals recovered totally from mange, while the disease progressed in the other five Iberian ibex (20% of the collared animals) and the animals died. The average estimated recovery time of the resistant animals was 245 [plus or minus] 277 days, and the estimated average survival time of the non-resistant Iberian ibex was 121 [plus or minus] 71 days. Non-resistant animals survived at least 100 days, while all of them died with less than 200 days. Sixty per cent of the resistant animals were recovered with less than 200 days. Conclusions: We report, for the first time, the successful use of radio collars for wildlife diseases monitoring using Iberian ibex/S. scabiei as a model. By using radio collars we documented that most of the Sarcoptes-infected Iberian ibex are resistant to this disease, and we estimated the average time for Iberian ibex recovering from mange infection and the average survival time of the non-resistant ones. We expect wider use of radio-collars for wild animals diseases monitoring, affected/not-affected animals interaction, and treatment efficacy, among others.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1756-3305			ZOOREC:ZOOR15002006965	J	"Alasaad, Samer; Granados, Jose E.; Fandos, Paulino; Cano-Manuel, Francisco-Javier; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Perez, Jesus M."

These populations were experimentally cultivated in the field and under controlled conditions. The insect antifeedant properties of their essential oils collected yearly from two locations were tested against Spodoptera littoralis, Myzus persicae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Additionally we studied their phytotoxic, antifungal and antiparasitic effects. The oils from cultivated A. absinthium were characterized by the presence of cis-epoxyocimene, chrysanthenol, and chrysanthenyl acetate. The variations observed in oil composition were mostly quantitative but also qualitative. (Z)-2,6-Dimethyl-5,7-octadien-2,3-diol has been isolated and identified by NMR. Among the oil samples, these rich in cis-epoxyocimene and sesquiterpenes were the most active ones against S. littoralis. (Z)-2,6-Dimethyl-5,7-octadien-2,3-diol showed moderate activity against S. littoralis. The strongest antifeedant effects were found for commercial A. absinthium oil samples rich in thujones and sabinyl acetate. F. oxysporum and F. solani were affected by oils from cultivated A. absinthium and commercial oil samples. Oils from cultivated A. absinthium showed antiparasitic effects against Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi with better results than the commercial samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All these environmental protection programmers are a consequence of its unique landscape in the context of the mid-latitude semiarid mountains, with enclaves of exceptional scientific and cultural value. Thanks to its high altitude, Sierra Nevada held the southernmost Quaternary glaciers in Europe, as well as it happened during the Little Ice Age. In turn, Sierra Nevada is also singular thanks to its vast cultural heritage, since very early societies settled on its slopes and valleys and accommodate their lifestyles and economy to the characteristics of this mountain environment. Currently, Sierra Nevada has become an important tourist centre and receives a large amount of visitors. This process of change has conditioned the implementation of a different economic model: it brings benefits to the populations but it involves changes in the landscape as well, sometimes questionable. From this perspective, a critical revision of the legislation is required balancing the sustainable economic development of the population and the preservation and safeguarding of the heritage values of the landscape. With this goal, we suggest creating and implementing the Sites of Geomorphological Interest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Alpine areas in the Mediterranean region are of special concern because of the high abundance of endemic species with narrow ranges. This study combined species distribution models, population structure analyses and Bayesian skyline plots to trace the past and future distribution and diversity of Linaria glacialis, an endangered narrow endemic species that inhabits summits of Sierra Nevada (Spain). The results showed that: (i) the habitat of this alpine-Mediterranean species in Sierra Nevada suffered little changes during glacial and interglacial stages of late Quaternary; (ii) climatic oscillations in the last millennium (Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age) moderately affected the demographic trends of L. glacialis; (iii) future warming conditions will cause severe range contractions; and (iv) genetic diversity will not diminish at the same pace as the distribution range. As a consequence of the low population structure of this species, genetic impoverishment in the alpine zones of Sierra Nevada should be limited during range contraction. We conclude that maintenance of large effective population sizes via high mutation rates and high levels of gene flow may promote the resilience of alpine plant species when confronted with global warming."									8	0	0	9	0	9			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000322886400005	23844700J	"Carinanos, Paloma; Diaz de la Guardia, Consuelo; Antonio Algarra, Jose; De Linares, Concepcion; Ma Irurita, Jose"				"Carinanos, Paloma/K-5696-2014; Diaz de la Guardia, Consuelo/L-2702-2014; "	"Diaz de la Guardia, Consuelo/0000-0002-1819-0610; De Linares, Concepcion/0000-0002-2047-3337"			The pollen counts as bioindicator of meteorological trends and tool for assessing the status of endangered species: the case of Artemisia in Sierra Nevada (Spain)								CLIMATIC CHANGE				119	03-Apr			799	813		10.1007/s10584-013-0751-2			Aug-13	2013	This study sought to analyse the effects of climate change on Artemisia species growing in Sierra Nevada, a high mountain range in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula, using pollen counts as a bioindicator. The study also examined the impact of Recovery Programmes implemented for the most endangered of these species. Analysis of historical Artemisia pollen-data series from 1992 to 2011 showed that flowering took place between late July and late September, but the trend towards higher summer temperatures detected over the series as a whole appeared to have delayed the start of flowering and brought forward the end of flowering, thus prompting a shortening of the season. A trend was also observed towards a delayed peak pollen period, together with a significant decline in the Annual Pollen Index, which was significantly influenced by rainfall over the months immediately prior to flowering. Recovery Programmes implemented for three species-Artemisia granatensis, A. alba subsp. nevadensis and A. umbelliformis-involved conservation measures including direct seeding and planting of seedlings. From the outset, these programmes led to a recovery of the Pollen Index, especially when using germinated seedlings, which adapted better than seeds to environmental conditions. In conclusion, pollen records proved to be a useful tool for assessing the status of endangered species.									2	0	0	2	0	3			0165-0009			WOS:000321955300021	J	"Monserrat, V.

For its position and characteristics it is considered as an important ""sensor"" for global changes. Water samples were collected during the ice-free season in order to observe changes in the bacterial community structure. Experiments were carried out complementing culture and culture-independent methods. Strong variations of the bacterial communities were recorded along the sampling period in particular regarding number and phylogenetic relationships of the microorganisms detected. At the season beginning, bacterial counts were rather high but strains belonged only to beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. By contrast, in the middle of the season, possibly due to external inputs, total number of bacteria decreased but other phylogenetic groups, such as alpha-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicute appeared. On the whole, Proteobacteria were the dominant microbiota. Bacterial diversity and presence of most abundant species were analysed by PCR-TGGE. Sequencing of TGGE bands confirmed that prevalent Bacteria populations were evolutively close to Proteobacteria with predominance of alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. Analysis of diversity and functional organization suggested that ""La Caldera"" bacterial microbiota, typical of oligotrophic and/or extreme environments with low habitability, was characterized by a community organized in an adequate distribution of dominant and resilient species. Although rather specialized, the community presented a sufficient functionality and flexibility to react to changing and stressing conditions. However, along the ice-free season, the community evolved showing more specialized populations with less adaptation abilities.

We mapped six ecosystem services delivered by forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south-east Spain) from the supply- to the demand-sides, taking into account the influence of protected areas on the capacity of supply services. Semi-structured interviews and geographical information system sources were used to map the supply-side, whereas 205 face-to-face questionnaires were distributed to assess and map the demand-side. Our results show the existence of consistent ecosystem service bundles in terms of both the supply- and demand-sides, particularly between erosion control-recreational hunting and between mushroom harvesting-nature tourism. We found a spatial scale mismatch for the erosion control, with its supply at the local scale and its demand at the regional-national scales, with implications at the institutional scale at which it should be managed. Consequently, mapping both the supply- and demand-sides is essential for environmental decision making because it can indicate where management interventions should be focused, either by defining high-priority areas for protection or defining the institutional scale at which these services should be managed.

Bush crickets have been proposed as biological control agents of T. pityocampa populations, although their characteristics as generalist predators suggest that this would be possible only during the low-density phases of the processionary population cycle. We combined observational and experimental approaches aiming to determine the role played by the bush cricket Steropleurus andalusius as a regulator of T.pityocampa. The synchrony of the phenology of T. pityocampa egg batches and the activity of bush crickets was poor, with the activity of bush crickets being longer than the period during which egg batches were available. The predation rate of bush crickets reached 23%, varied in time and space, and was independent of T. pityocampa egg-batch density. There was no relationship between the egg-batch densities and bush cricket abundance, and no response to experimental variations in egg-batch density. Analysis of microhabitat selection suggests that T. pityocampa egg-batch predation is a by-product of the substrate selected by bush crickets for mating, and does not correspond with active searching of egg batches as food. These findings do not rule out the possibilty of bush crickets being natural regulators of T. pityocampa populations, although they impose limits with respect to their future use in biological control.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1461-9555			WOS:000317688200012	J	"Perez-Martinez, Carmen; Jimenez, Laura; Moreno, Emilio; Conde-Porcuna, Jose M."

In situ studies were carried out using sediment emergence traps and plankton sampling, and the sediment egg bank was analyzed. A laboratory experiment was performed to explore the role of photoperiod and temperature as hatching cues for D. pulicaria. We hypothesized that the time window for emergence would be short and that hatching cues would be linked to the variable ice-break period. In the field, D. pulicaria showed a highly synchronized emergence in both years. The hatching period was restricted to 3 weeks during and immediately after the thaw. In the laboratory experiment, no hatchings were observed in the dark treatment and neither photoperiod nor temperature affected hatching rates. Therefore, the presence of light, which corresponds with the period of ice-break, was essential for triggering dormancy termination of D. pulicaria. Our results show that the period when the ice-break occurs is a key event for Daphnia population development. The longer ice-free periods predicted by climate change in the alpine lakes could therefore have important effects on the crustacean population dynamics of these systems.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-8158			WOS:000316332300004	J	"Garcia-Alix, A.; Jimenez-Espejo, F.

A correct determination of natural lead levels is very important in order to evaluate anthropogenic lead contributions. In this paper, the anthropogenic signature of early metallurgy in Southern Iberia during the Holocene, more specifically during the Late Prehistory, was assessed by mean of a multiproxy approach: comparison of atmospheric lead pollution, fire regimes, deforestation, mass sediment transport, and archeological data. Although the onset of metallurgy in Southern Iberia is a matter of controversy, here we show the oldest lead pollution record from Western Europe in a continuous paleoenvironmental sequence, which suggests clear lead pollution caused by metallurgical activities since similar to 3900 cal BP (Early Bronze Age). This lead pollution was especially important during Late Bronze and Early Iron ages. At the same time, since similar to 4000 cal BP, an increase in fire activity is observed in this area, which is also coupled with deforestation and increased erosion rates. This study also shows that the lead pollution record locally reached near present-day values many times in the past, suggesting intensive use and manipulation of lead during those periods in this area.

To estimate the water balance in a healthy population of sportspeople from Southern Spain and determine the sources of their fluid intake, evaluating the contribution of different types of drink and comparing the results by sex and province of residence. Methods. Three hundred eighty-six sportspeople (231 males, 152 females) were enrolled in the study. A questionnaire was administered to calculate nutrient intake through diet and physical activity, and anthropometric measures were taken according to ISAK standards. SPSS-15 was used for data analyses. Results. Fruit juice, tap water, bottled water, processed fruit juice, carbonated drinks, and isotonic drinks comprised 96% of the total water intake. Simple sugar consumption represented 4.44% of daily calorie intake. Significant differences were found between sexes and between professionals and amateurs. The amount of drinks consumed varied as a function of the quality of the drinking water, which significantly differed among the eight Andalusian provinces. Conclusion. This study population did not fully meet fluid intake recommendations, compliance with hydration recommendations varied as a function of the sex and the amateur or professional status of these sportspeople. The pattern of drinks consumption also differed according to their place of residence.	Objetivos. Estimar el balance h_drico en deportistas sanos del sur de Espaa.

The proxies studied record an arid period from ca. 3800 to 3100 cal yr BP characterized by more xerophytic vegetation and lower lake levels. A humid period is recorded between ca. 3100 and 1850 cal yr BP, which occurred in two steps: (1) an increase in evergreen Quercus between 3100 and 2500 cal yr BP, indicating milder conditions than previously and (2) an increase in deciduous Quercus and higher lake levels, between ca. 2500 and 1850 cal yr BP, indicating a further increase in humidity and reduction in seasonal contrast. Humid maxima occurred during the Roman Humid Period, previously identified in other studies in the Mediterranean region. Intensified fire activity at this time could be related to an increase in fuel load and/or in human disturbance. An arid period subsequently occurred between 1850 and 650 cal yr BP, though a decrease in Quercus and an increase in xerophytes. The alternation of persistent North Atlantic Oscillation modes probably played an important role in controlling these humid-arid cycles. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

High mountains are extreme habitats which, because of their marked temperature decrease with altitude, impose difficulties for reptile thermoregulation, as the number of optimum-temperature days diminish in altitude. We studied the activity patterns of the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which has a wide altitudinal distribution, at six sampling stations that spanned an altitudinal range from 300 to 2500 m asl in Sierra Nevada (SE Iberian Peninsula). We performed censuses of the species during the seasonal and daily activity period, and measured lizard body temperature and environmental temperature in the six sampling plots along the altitude gradient. The body temperature of the lizards remained closely the same even though environmental temperature decreased around 9 C along that gradient. Seasonal activity peaked at the beginning of the activity period in highlands, but in the middle of the season in middle and lowland regions. However, newborns appeared in the field almost at the same time along the altitude gradient. We suggest that the thermoregulatory strategies of the lizards must vary along this altitudinal gradient, permitting lizards to keep their body temperature close to a very similar optimum and thus, develop very similar circa-annual activity patterns.

Both the maternal and paternal genomes are expressed in somatic tissues, but the paternal genome is systematically excluded from the germ line, which is therefore purely maternal. Recently, a unique case of hybridogenesis at a social level was reported in the desert ant Cataglyphis hispanica. All workers are sexually produced hybridogens, whereas sexual forms (new queens and males) are produced by queens through parthenogenesis. Thus, only maternal genes are perpetuated across generations. Here, we show that such an unusual reproductive strategy also evolved in two other species of Cataglyphis belonging to the same phylogenetic group, Cataglyphis velox and Cataglyphis mauritanica. In both species, queens mate exclusively with males originating from a different genetic lineage than their own to produce hybrid workers, while they use parthenogenesis to produce the male and female reproductive castes. In contrast to single-queen colonies of C. hispanica, colonies of C. velox and C. mauritanica are headed by several queens. Most queens within colonies share the same multilocus genotype and never transmit their mates' alleles to the reproductive castes. Social hybridogenesis in the desert ants has direct consequences on the genetic variability of populations and on caste determination. We also discuss the maintenance of this reproductive strategy within the genus Cataglyphis.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0962-1083			WOS:000314220900005	23216892J	"Fletcher, William J.; Debret, Maxime; Goni, Maria Fernanda Sanchez"					"Sanchez Goni, Maria Fernanda/0000-0001-8238-7488; Fletcher, William/0000-0001-8918-0690"			Mid-Holocene emergence of a low-frequency millennial oscillation in western Mediterranean climate: Implications for past dynamics of the North Atlantic atmospheric westerlies								HOLOCENE				23	2			153	166		10.1177/0959683612460783			Feb-13	2013	The nature and tempo of Holocene climate variability is examined in the record of forest vegetation from western Mediterranean marine core MD95-2043. Episodes of forest decline occurred at 10.1, 9.2, 8.3, 7.4, 5.4-4.5 and 3.7-2.9 cal. ka BP, and between 1.9 cal. ka BP and the top of the record (1.3 cal. ka BP). Wavelet analysis confirms a similar to 900 yr periodicity prior to and during the early Holocene and the dominance of a similar to 1750 yr periodicity after 6 cal. ka BP. The similar to 900 yr periodicity has counterparts in numerous North Atlantic and Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records, and in solar irradiance proxies (Delta C-14 and Be-10), and may relate to a Sun-climate connection during the early Holocene. Comparisons between the MD95-2043 forest record and strategically located records from Morocco, Iceland, Norway and Israel suggest that the similar to 1750 yr mid- to late-Holocene oscillation reflects shifts between a prevailing strong and weak state of the zonal flow, with impacts similar to the positive and negative modes of the present-day North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The mid-to late-Holocene millennial oscillation in zonal flow appears closely coupled to North Atlantic surface ocean circulation dynamics, and may have been driven by an internal oscillation in deep-water convection strength. The findings suggest that the mid-Holocene transition in western Mediterranean climate was accompanied by a shift in the fundamental tempo of millennial-scale variability, reflecting contrasting sensitivity of the North Atlantic climate system to different forcing factors (solar versus oceanic) under deglacial and fully interglacial conditions.									26	0	0	13	0	26			0959-6836	1477-0911		WOS:000313980100001	J	"Huertegn, Jochen; Rudersdorf, Andreas; Gruetzner, Christoph; Reicherter, Klaus"				Gruetzner, Christoph/D-6888-2012				Morphotectonics of the Padul-Niguelas Fault Zone, southern Spain								ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS				56	6	SI				S0679	10.4401/ag-6208			2013	2013	The Padul-Niguelas Fault Zone (PNFZ) is situated at the south-western mountain front of the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) in the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordilleras and belongs to a NW-SE trending system of normal faults dipping SW. The PNFZ constitutes a major tectonic and lithological boundary in the Betics, and separates the metamorphic units of the Alpujdrride Complex from Upper Tertiary to Quaternary deposits. Due to recent seismicity and several morphological and geological indicators, such as preserved fault scarps, triangular facets, deeply incised valleys and faults in the colluvial wedges, the PNFZ is suspected to be a tectonically active feature of the south-eastern Granada Basin. We performed morphotectonic GIS analyses based on digital elevation models (DEM, cell size: 10 m) to obtain tectonic activity classes for each out-cropping segment of the PNFZ. We have determined the following geomorphic indices: mountain front sinuosity, stream-length gradient index, concavity index and valley floor width to height ratio. The results show a differentiation in the states of activity along the fault zone strike. The western and eastern segments of the PNFZ indicate a higher tectonic activity compared to the center of the fault zone. We discuss and critically examine the comparability and reproducibility of geomorphic analyses, concluding that careful interpretation is necessary, if no ground-truthing can be performed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1593-5213	2037-416X		WOS:000335834000011	J	"Ari Noriega, Jorge; Solis, Cesil; Garcia, Hector; Murillo-Ramos, Leidys; Manuel Renjifo, Juan; Eliecer Olarte, Jorge"								Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) from the Caribbean Region of Colombia								CALDASIA				35	2			465	477					2013	2013	"The subfamily Scarabaeinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is an important group in ecosystems because of their role in nutrient recycling. Studies on the diversity of Scarabaeinae in Colombia are available for certain biogeographic regions. However, some areas such as the Caribbean region are still poorly studied. In an attempt to fill this gap in the knowledge, a complete revision of fauna is presented based on the study of dung beetle species deposited in 16 national entomological collections and from literature records. A total of 90 species belonging to 24 genera in 6 tribes were found. Twenty species were newly recorded for La Guajira, 18 for Sucre, 11 for Magdalena, 9 for Bolivar, 9 for Cordoba, 3 for Atlantico and 2 for Cesar. The department with the highest richness is Magdalena, probably because it is the best sampled throughout its altitude gradient. When the species composition is analyzed, the Caribbean region presents scarce endemism except for the high lands of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The genus Onthophagus is the most diverse in the region; the species with the broadest altitude range is Ontherus sanctaemartae, found from 700 to 2500 m above sea level. The species composition of the Caribbean region is homogenous in the lowlands, showing a strong affinity with the biogeographic region of Choco. Four different altitude clusters were recognized: lowlands (0-500 m), high hills (>500-900 m), subandean-andean zone (>900 to 2500 m) and high mountains (>2500 m). An increase in the homogeneity is likely expected with further sampling. Finally, it is essential to intensify the sampling in this region, especially in the isolate mountain systems."									0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-5232			WOS:000329567800016	J	"Gavilan, Rosario G.; Jimenez-Alfaro, Borja; Bacchetta, Gianluigi; Dimopoulos, Panayotis; Mucina, Ladislav"								Mountain Biodiversity patterns in Southern Europe and North Africa								Lazaroa				34				7	10		10.5209/rev_LAZA.2013.v34.n1.43650			2013	2013	About 19% of European population lives in mountainous regions - a notably more than the global average.

Short-term (2001-2008) changes in vascular plant species richness, cover and abundance were studied on four summits in the Sierra Nevada (Spain). The resurvey revealed a decrease in species richness on each summit, which is confirmed by small-scale changes in species abundance within the same summits. These changes involve local losses of high-elevation endemic species as well as the new appearance of predominantly more widespread species. Some of the latter species were also observed to expand elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada. On a small scale, cover of several endemic species decreased and cover of some species that occur on a wider altitudinal range increased. Although the observed changes are statistically only marginally or not significant, they are largely consistent with pan-European studies suggesting stagnant or declining species richness on summits of the Mediterranean biome and a 'thermophilisation' of the species composition in high mountain plant communities over the past years. Even though we cannot rule out other non-climatic factors, our results give rise to concern about the situation of the mainly endemic high-altitude flora of the Sierra Nevada and give an incentive to intensify monitoring efforts.									1	0		3	0	3			0210-9778	1988-3307		BCI:BCI201400105210	S	"Pimentel, Rafael; Herrero, Javier; Jose Polo, Maria"				"Herrero, Javier/K-6880-2014; Polo, Maria J./L-8018-2014"	"Herrero, Javier/0000-0002-5741-6301; Polo, Maria J./0000-0002-6296-2198"	"Neale, CMU; Maltese, A"		Estimating snow albedo patterns in a Mediterranean site from Landsat TM and ETM plus images								REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XV		Proceedings of SPIE		8887						88870L	10.1117/12.2029064			2013	2013	The albedo of snow affects the shortwave radiative flux at the land-atmosphere interface, so that it therefore plays an important role in the snow mass and energy balance. In semiarid areas, their particular climate conditions enhance the spatiotemporal variability of the snow albedo during the snow cover periods, increasing its difficulty in being measured and monitored. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for measuring snow albedo evolution. Ten years of Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 Thematic Mapper images were analysed to determine a trend in the albedo evolution throughout the year in a Mediterranean site, Sierra Nevada Mountain (Southern Spain). A pattern in snow albedo from all the snow pixel in each Landsat scene was obtained. It ranges from 0.8 in new snow to 0.4 in old dirty snow, with a decreasing rate of 0.003 albedo per day. This trend was validated with 5 specific location, where the snow is more persistent while the pixel remains well-illuminated.

The two fungi produced spores in pot cultures, using O. vulgatum, N. nevadensis, H. lanatus and T repens as bait plants. Acaulospora pustulata has a pustulate spore ornamentation similar to that of Diversispora pustulata, while A. tortuosa has surface projections that resemble innumerous hyphae-like structures that are more rudimentary than the hyphae-like structures known for spores of Sacculospora baltica or Glomus tortuosum. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of the ITS and partial LSU of the ribosomal genes reveal that both fungi are new species within the Acaulosporaceae. They are most closely related to A. alpina and undescribed Acaulospora species. With 45-72 lam spore size, Acaulospora pustulata is the smallest Acaulospora species known so far, while A. tortuosa has slightly larger spores (61-84(-94) mu m), which is in the range known for several other Acaulospora species like A. longula, A. alpina, A. nivalis and A. sieverdingii that have either smooth or pitted spore surfaces. These two fungi might play an important role in helping their endangered hosts O. vulgatum and N. nevadensis to survive under the stressed environments of the high mountains of Sierra Nevada.									12	0	0	11	0	12			0029-5035			WOS:000327568900003	J	"Petitpierre, E.; Daccordi, M."

Still, only a few studies have been focused at a community level. Of particular interest are high mountain species, because of the high frequency of narrow endemics and their higher susceptibility to extinction due to the effects of climate change. In the present study we explored genome size variation and polyploidy incidence in the entomophilous plant communities of two distinct mountain ranges, the Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa National Parks. For that, chromosome numbers and DNA ploidies were assessed through a review of the literature, and the genome size and incidence of polyploidy in 39 taxa from several key genera were estimated using flow cytometry. In this study, first genome size estimations are given for 32 taxa. The majority of the analyzed taxa presented very small to small genome sizes (2C <= 7.0 pg), with no differences being detected between genome size and geographic origin and distribution ranges. A low incidence of polyploid taxa was observed (23.3%), with polyploids being more common in Picos de Europa than in Sierra Nevada. Most taxa inferred as polyploids were high altitude plants, but no clear pattern between polyploidy incidence and endemic status was observed. The obtained results are discussed within the context of angiosperm's genome size variation and of polyploidy incidence in alpine and arctic flora, contributing to the scientific knowledge of these natural communities of great biological importance.									1	1	0	1	0	2			0211-1322			WOS:000323415900004	B	"Verbena, J.

Recently, interest in this phenomenon has been revived, due to its potential contribution to elucidation of developmental mechanisms. Within insects, gynandromorphism includes several examples in Lepidoptera (mainly in the Macrolepidoptera). Yet, it is rare in the far less strikingly sexually dimorphic Microlepidoptera, mainly because it is harder to use external features to recognize gynandromorphs in this taxon. Here, we describe the first known case of gynandromorphism in Scythrididae, belonging to the genus Enolmis Duponchel, 1845. Enolmis species have light coloured external features, asymmetrical male genitalia, and developed henia in females. The different parts of male and female genitalia present in the Enolmis gynandromorph individual are described here.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-1036	1804-6487		WOS:000323238200025	S	"Cunniffe, R.; Castro-Tirado, A.

The origin of these rock (1)glaciers is related to the deglaciation process and the considerable geomorphologic activity of the walls rather than caused by extreme periglacial climate.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0212-9426			WOS:000315749200007	J	"Martin-Vivaldi, Manuel; Jose Soler, Juan; Moller, Anders Pape; Perez-Contreras, Tomas; Soler, Manuel"				"Soler, Juan/H-2363-2011; Perez-Contreras, Tomas/M-8065-2014"	"Soler, Juan/0000-0003-2990-1489; Perez-Contreras, Tomas/0000-0002-2271-1706"			The importance of nest-site and habitat in egg recognition ability of potential hosts of the Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus								IBIS				155	1			140	155		10.1111/ibi.12000			Jan-13	2013	The intensity of selection exerted by brood parasites on their hosts depends on the proportion of nests that are parasitized and the fitness costs of parasitism. Nest detection by brood parasites influences the probability of parasitism, and we propose that the difficulty faced by brood parasites of finding nests on the ground may make ground-nesting species subject to lower levels of parasitism, causing a reduction in levels of defence compared with species breeding in shrubs, trees and elsewhere above the ground. We tested the prediction that the rejection rate of Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus eggs by hosts is inversely related to the frequency with which they build nests on the ground, both at local and at continental scales. First, we used estimates of the rejection rate of non-mimetic model eggs experimentally introduced into the nests of 26 potential host species breeding in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of southern Spain. Most species tested in the Sierra Nevada showed high rejection rates of both mimetic and non-mimetic eggs, whereas the European Robin Erithacus rubecula, with a low rejection rate, was the only species that was regularly parasitized. At the continental scale we used all available published information on rejection rates of non-mimetic models by European hosts of the Common Cuckoo. The frequency of ground-nesting explained interspecific variation in rejection rate of non-mimetic model eggs both for the species tested in the Sierra Nevada and for all European hosts after controlling for all other life-history variables known to affect rejection rates. An effect of the abundance of trees in a particular habitat, previously shown to affect parasitism by the Common Cuckoo, was only apparent from analyses of continental-scale data and not from the Sierra Nevada mountains, suggesting that particular properties of mountainous areas affect Common Cuckoo parasitism. Ground-nesting species showed lower rejection rates than species breeding in bushes or trees. These results suggest that species nesting on the ground may have suffered lower parasitism pressures in their historical coevolutionary interactions with the Common Cuckoo.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0019-1019			WOS:000316326600013	J	"Werner, Olaf; Rams, Susana; Kucera, Jan; Larrain, Juan; Afonina, Olga M.; Pisa, Sergio; Maria Ros, Rosa"				"Kucera, Jan/B-3633-2009; ROS, ROSA /J-9780-2014; WERNER, OLAF/K-2374-2014; Rams Sanchez, Susana/K-2424-2014"	"Kucera, Jan/0000-0002-0230-5997; ROS, ROSA /0000-0003-2115-2911; WERNER, OLAF/0000-0003-0601-3964; Rams Sanchez, Susana/0000-0002-6508-0860"			New data on the moss genus Hymenoloma (Bryophyta), with special reference to H. mulahaceni								CRYPTOGAMIE BRYOLOGIE				34	1			13	30					Jan-13	2013	A molecular and morphological study using two chloroplast molecular markers (rps4 and trnL-F) was carried out with specimens belonging to Hymenoloma mulahaceni, a species described at the end of the 19th century from the Sierra Nevada Mountains in southern Spain as a member of Oreoweisia. The comparison with Asian, European, and North American material of Dicranoweisia intermedia proved the conspecifity of both taxa, which was corroborated by molecular data. Therefore, the distribution area of H. mulahaceni is extended to U.S.A., Canada, Greenland, and several Asian countries (Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). We also tested the monophyly of Hymenoloma sensu Ochyra et al. (2003), by including in the analysis the Holarctic taxa assigned to the genus together with Chilean material identified as H. antarcticum (putatively synonymous with the type of Hymenoloma) and H. crispulum. Phylogenetic analysis of basal haplolepidous taxa taking into account different genera, mainly of the Dicranales but also of Bryoxiphiales and Scouleriales, confirmed the monophyly of Hymenoloma and suggested a close relationship with the Scouleriaceae sensu Hedderson et aL (2004), while Dicranoweisia was resolved within Rhabdoweisiaceae. Molecular data helped us to show that Hymenoloma brevipes, morphologically closely related to H. crispulum, is a distinct taxon from H. antarcticum. This challenges the earlier records of H. crispulum from the Southern Hemisphere but a comprehensive revision is necessary to confirm its status in the region. A key to the genera Dicranoweisia and Hymenoloma and the European species of Hymenoloma is included.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1290-0796			WOS:000315174900002	J	"Helbling, E.

This input further attenuates the penetration of solar radiation, leading to the view that opaque lakes are more ""protected"" from solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than clear ones. Vertical mixing, however, complicates this view as cells are exposed to fluctuating radiation regimes, for which the effects have, in general, been neglected. Furthermore, the combined impacts of mixing, together with those of UVR and nutrient inputs are virtually unknown. In this study, we carried out complex in situ experiments in three high mountain lakes of Spain (Lake Enol in the National Park Picos de Europa, Asturias, and lakes Las Yeguas and La Caldera in the National Park Sierra Nevada, Granada), used as model ecosystems to evaluate the joint impact of these climate change variables. The main goal of this study was to address the question of how short-term pulses of nutrient inputs, together with vertical mixing and increased UVR fluxes modify the photosynthetic responses of phytoplankton. The experimentation consisted in all possible combinations of the following treatments: (a) solar radiation: UVR+ PAR (280-700 nm) versus PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) alone (400-700 nm); (b) nutrient addition (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)): ambient versus addition (P to reach to a final concentration of 30 mu g P L-1, and N to reach N: P molar ratio of 31); and (c) mixing: mixed (one rotation from surface to 3m depth (speed of 1 m 4 min(-1), total of 10 cycles)) versus static. Our findings suggest that under ambient nutrient conditions there is a synergistic effect between vertical mixing and UVR, increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic inhibition and excretion of organic carbon (EOC) from opaque lakes as compared to algae that received constant mean irradiance within the epilimnion. The opposite occurs in clear lakes where antagonistic effects were determined, with mixing partially counteracting the negative effects of UVR. Nutrient input, mimicking atmospheric pulses from Saharan dust, reversed this effect and clear lakes became more inhibited during mixing, while opaque lakes benefited from the fluctuating irradiance regime. These climate change related scenarios of nutrient input and increased mixing, would not only affect photosynthesis and production in lakes, but might also further influence the microbial loop and trophic interactions via enhanced EOC under fluctuating UVR exposure."									11	1	0	10	0	11			1726-4170			WOS:000315093000025	J	Bahrami, Shahram								Tectonic controls on the morphometry of alluvial fans around Danehkhoshk anticline, Zagros, Iran								GEOMORPHOLOGY				180				217	230		10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.10.012			JAN 1 2013	2013	Alluvial fans are important landforms where their morphology and morphometry reflect changes in tectonic, climate, base level, and drainage basin characteristics. Along the margins of tectonically active mountain ranges like the Zagros Mountains, alluvial fans are generally assumed to act as useful landforms for identifying the level of tectonic activity. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between active tectonics and morphometric characteristics of alluvial fans around Danehkhoshk anticline in the Simply Folded Belt of Zagros. Morphometric characteristics of alluvial fans, such as area (FA), slope (SF) length of base (BF), width/length ratio (W/L), radius (R), sweep angle (SA) and entrenchment (E) as well as valley floor width-to-height ratio (Vf) and strata dips of anticline limbs (DAL), were measured. The study area was sub-divided into eight tectonic zones and then the mean values of the above-mentioned parameters were calculated in each zone. Result reveals that values of SA, BF and E are directly proportional to DAL The poor relationships between catchment characteristics (slope and area) and fan parameters are probably due to extensive karstic landforms of catchments having complex hydrologic systems and, hence, result in complex catchment/fan relations. The highly entrenched fans with high sweep angles and long bases are characteristic of tectonically active fronts of Danehkhoshk anticline, having V-shaped valleys (higher Vf values), steep triangular facets and more rotated limbs (higher DAL values). Apart from the tectonic control on fan development, the fan head entrenchment and negative accumulation spaces on most alluvial fans can be attributed to decreased sediment load and discharge the drier the present-day climate regime.

These remains have been studied by means of environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with different detectors, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The red colour is caused by the presence of cinnabar (HgS) in the pores of the fossil bones and teeth, filling the dentinal and bone tubules and other cavities that at life were filled by organic matter. A nearby cinnabar outcrop in the metamorphic materials of Sierra Nevada is interpreted as the source of mercury. This element was mobilized by meteoric diagenesis and incorporated as cinnabar in a palustrine environment, occupying pores and cavities of mammal remains shortly after the degradation of the organic matter (post-mortem enrichment), during the early diagenesis.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0024-1164			WOS:000312650400001	J	"Fuentes Carretero, Julian Manuel; Ruiz Girela, Mario"								On the presence of Sorbus intermedia (Ehrh.)

Besides, the system calculates automatically several indicators useful to assess different ecological functions of Sierra Nevada habitats: phenology, seasonality of biomass production, duration of snow cover, etc. We also calculate trends in those indicators. These indicators are aggregated into composite indexes that allow the identification of habitats suffering significant changes in both their ecological functions and physical context. Finally we created an ontology that adds semantic meaning to the whole dataset. This allows the formulation of complex questions regarding the changes observed in habitats.

In the realm of biodiversity monitoring and reporting on conservation status of Natura 2000 habitats, such products must meet different needs of local site manager and national environmental agencies, up to European authorities. Hence, the quality of these upcoming Earth observation based technologies must be validated in a pre-operational phase. The case of the MS.

Measurements related to ozone injury included visible chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth, which together compose the Ozone Injury Index (OII). The OII values observed in Catalonia were similar to those in California, but OII alone correlated poorly to ambient ozone in all sites. Combining ambient ozone with GIS variables related to landscape variability of plant hydrological status, derived from stepwise regressions, produced models with R-2 = 0.35, p = 0.016 in Catalonia, R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.001 in Yosemite and R-2 = 0.33, p = 0.007 in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks in California. Individual OII components in Catalonia were modeled with improved success compared to the original full OII, in particular visible chlorotic mottling (R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001). The results show that ozone is negatively impacting forest health in California and Catalonia and also that modeling ozone injury improves by including GIS variables related to plant water relations.

At the watershed outlet the runoff, suspended sediment concentration, total solute concentrations and dissolved nutrients (N-NO3, N-NH4, H2PO4 and K) in streamflow were continuously monitored. The runoff was highly variable, ranging between 53.4 and 154.7 mm year(-1), with an average of 97.6 mm year(-1). In contrast, sediment yields were more regular, averaging 1.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The hydrological response of the watershed depended mainly on rainfall intensity. Formerly, 32% of the watershed was forested and runoff was more regular, despite the typical Mediterranean rainfall cycle; however, due to forest area reduction to 17% and the increase in abandoned farmland area (18%) in recent decades, the runoff variability has increased. Greater amounts of solutes (32.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were exported, so that this water is considered as poor for irrigation use. The temporal nutrient export was related to seasonal discharge fluctuations as well as daily concentrations. In addition, the nutrient concentrations of the water discharged were lower than threshold limits cited in water-quality standards for agricultural use and for potable water, with the exception of K (65.9 mg L-1), which may degrade surface waters as well as irrigated soils.

Yet models of competition often neglect important variation in species-specific responses. Furthermore, functions used to model changes in growth rate with size do not always allow for potential complexity. Using a large data set from old-growth forests in California, models were parameterized relating growth rate to tree size and competition for four common species. Several functions relating growth rate to size were tested. Competition models included parameters for tree size, competitor size, and competitor distance. Competitive strength was allowed to vary by species. The best ranked models (using Akaike's information criterion) explained between 18% and 40% of the variance in growth rate, with each species showing a strong response to competition. Models indicated that relationships between competition and growth varied substantially among species. The results also suggested that the relationship between growth rate and tree size can be complex and that how we model it can affect not only our ability to detect that complexity but also whether we obtain misleading results. In this case, for three of four species, the best model captured an apparent and unexpected decline in potential growth rate for the smallest trees in the data set.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0045-5067			WOS:000311729700011	J	"Sarasa, M.; Soriguer, R.

However, methods of measurements of SSC, such as horns of ungulates, vary throughout the literature. Thus, the accuracy of horn growth measurements as proxies of true horn growth and the comparability of results inferred from different horn growth measurements may be questionable. We used the horns of Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica to compare horn growth measurements and to analyse reliability with true horn growth. Our results reveal that measurements used in previous studies differed substantially from true horn growth and volume estimated as a barrel appeared as the best proxy of annular segments of horns in the Iberian ibex. Horn growth measurements are not necessarily mutually comparable, just as classical measurements are not necessarily representative of true horn growth. We discuss the wider implications of these results and suggest that biological processes linked to horns of ungulates should be reappraised using improved and accurate measurements because horn growth pattern is a key factor in sustainable management and conservation plans of ungulate species around the world.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0952-8369			WOS:000310330900002	J	"Sarasa, Mathieu; Perez, Jesus M.; Granados, Jose-Enrique; Soriguer, Ramon C."

Our results revealed that nursing a kid does not seem detrimental to neatness in female Iberian ibex in terms of nonimmunological compatibility to contact-transmitted foreign bodies. Consequently, it seems that increased susceptibility of breeding females to contact-transmitted parasites may be mainly mediated by increased exposure or increased immunological compatibility to parasites.									2	0	0	0	0	2			Aug-01	1480-3283		WOS:000310859700010	J	"Garcia-Alix, Antonio; Jimenez-Moreno, Gonzalo; Scott Anderson, R.; Jimenez Espejo, Francisco J.; Delgado Huertas, Antonio"				"Garcia-Alix, Antonio/H-2464-2011; Delgado, Antonio/F-6866-2011; "	"Garcia-Alix, Antonio/0000-0002-1823-488X; Delgado, Antonio/0000-0002-7240-1570; Jimenez Moreno, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7185-8686"			Holocene environmental change in southern Spain deduced from the isotopic record of a high-elevation wetland in Sierra Nevada								JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY				48	3			471	484		10.1007/s10933-012-9625-2			Oct-12	2012	"Small lakes and wetlands from high elevation within the Sierra Nevada Range (southern Spain) preserve a complete post-glacial Holocene record. Isotopic, TOC and C/N analyses, carried out on a sediment core, show various stages in the evolution of the Borreguiles de la Virgen, which today constitute a small bog at about 2,950 m above sea level. Glacial erosion generated a cirque depression, which became a small lake during the first phase of infilling (from 8,200 to 5,100 cal yr BP), as suggested by sedimentary evidence, including an atomic C/N ratio generally below 20, low TOC values and the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the record. These results imply significant algal productivity, which is confirmed by the microscopic algal remains. Drier conditions became established progressively in this area from 5,100 to 3,700 cal yr BP. Subsequently, the lake evolved into a bog as shown by geochemical evidence (C/N ratios above 20, high TOC content and low delta C-13 values). Unstable conditions prevailed from 3,600 to 700 cal yr BP; an extremely low sedimentation rate and scarcity of data from this period do not allow us to make a coherent interpretation. Fluctuating conditions were recorded during the last 700 cal yr BP, with wetter conditions prevailing during the first part of the interval (with C/N rate below 20) up to 350 years ago. In general, a gradual trend toward more arid conditions occurred since 6,900 cal yr BP, with a further increase in aridity since 5,100 cal yr BP.

Moreover, there is scant information about the effect of salvage logging on ecosystem processes mediated by species interactions. We manipulated a burnt pine forest to experimentally analyze the effect of burnt-wood management on the colonization of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) mediated by acorn dispersal by Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius). Three replicates of three treatments were established in an 18-ha plot: salvage logging (SL), non-intervention (NI), and partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass in situ). We hypothesized that different burnt-wood management could alter jays' landscape perception and thus the pattern of seed dispersal and seedling recruitment. We monitored jay abundance in each treatment for three winters and three breeding periods, and jay flights of potential acorn dispersal between nearby oak trees and the treatments. We also searched for oak seedlings recruited in the experimental plot for five years following the fire. Jays were recorded significantly more times (87%) in NI, and movements to this treatment during the acorn dispersal period were also more frequent (81% of the flights). Oak seedlings were also more abundant in NI (ca. 55%) than in SL or PCL (ca. 25% each), despite a strong effect of small remnants of live pines. The results show that the burnt forest, if unsalvaged, still provides a suitable habitat for jays, while salvage logging reduces the strength of this key plant-animal interaction for oak natural regeneration. Nonintervention policies after a forest fire therefore provide the opportunity for adaptive management that helps reduce restoration costs and increase the resilience of the system."									2	0	0	2	0	2			2150-8925			WOS:000327303500007	J	"Sainz-Barain, Marta; Zamora-Munoz, Carmen"				Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/K-7050-2014	Zamora-Munoz, Carmen/0000-0002-3037-1529			The larva and life history of Stenophylax nycterobius (McLachlan, 1875) (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) in high mountain streams (Sierra Nevada, Spain) and key to the Iberian larvae of the genus.

Although it is recognized that plant species vary in their flammability, we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how plant traits influence fire and how litter mixtures behave in a fire. As modified fire regimes and climate change shift the species composition of communities, a mechanistic perspective is especially important to understand and predict fire in potentially novel plant communities. This work addresses three questions: (i) How do eight species common in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest differ in their litter flammability? (ii) What leaf traits are associated with various flammability components? and (iii) Do individual species measurements predict multi-species combinations, or are there non-additive effects? 2. Leaf litter was collected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, from eight dominant tree species in mixed-conifer forest. Controlled flammability tests were performed on reconstructed monospecific litter beds and on mixed litter beds, using litter from three species. We tested for non-additive effects in multi-species mixtures using the weighted mean of single-species measures for each flammability component as a null expectation for each mixture; departures from this null indicated non-additive effects. 3. Most flammability components fell within two major axes of variation, one relating to total heat release and another to fire intensity. The eight species differed significantly in all flammability components, with large-leaved species creating litter that burned with higher intensity. 4. Non-additive species mixture effects are common in this system. Flammability tends to be driven by the most flammable component of the mixture. 5. Synthesis. We have demonstrated positive non-additive effects in mixtures of leaf litter. The most flammable constituent species of a mixture has disproportionate effects on the fire environment faced by the entire community. This could potentially influence community assembly and alter the selective environment faced by co-occurring species."									12	0	0	12	0	12			0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000307554300011	J	"Mayoral, Jaime G.; Barranco, Pablo"								A new genus and species of larval mite (Acari: Prostigmata: Microtrombidiidae) parasitising Orthoptera (Tettigoniidae) from the Sierra Nevada, Spain								SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY				83	1			77	84		10.1007/s11230-012-9370-y			Sep-12	2012	Nevada capileirarum n. g., n. sp.

Thermobarometry from the NFC in the Sierra Alhamilla reveals an inverted geothermal gradient, with peak temperatures and pressures of 560 degrees C and 13 kbar reached in the uppermost tectonic unit. The NFC cooled during exhumation, defining a linear PT path that remained within the stability field of kyanite until the aluminosilicate breakdown reaction. Geo- and thermochronology suggest the NFC was subducted and exhumed to the surface within similar to 10 m.y., recording an early stage of fast cooling from peak T through similar to 250 degrees C, followed by a late stage of slower cooling as the rocks approached the surface. The exhumation is associated with a progressive change in kinematics, with early co-axial fabrics showing NNE-SSW-trending stretching lineations, and late non-coaxial fabrics showing SSW-trending lineations. A new tectonic model is proposed to explain these data, in which rocks at the leading edge of the Iberian margin were subducted southeastward beneath the thin, hot, Alboran lithosphere to form the NFC. The rocks at the top of the slab began to be exhumed once they reached 48-67 km depth. They were initially exhumed rapidly along the top of the subducting slab, in a subduction channel geometry; then upon reaching the middle crust, were captured by a low-angle detachment fault with a WSW shear sense and final exhumation was accommodated more slowly in a core-complex geometry."									20	0	0	0	0	20			0278-7407			WOS:000308102000001	J	"Pedrera, Antonio; Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus; Lamas, Francisco; Ruiz-Constan, Ana"				"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/K-3640-2012; RUIZ-CONSTAN, ANA/L-4634-2014; Pedrera, Antonio/L-6463-2014"	"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/0000-0002-3493-2637; RUIZ-CONSTAN, ANA/0000-0002-0920-6369; Pedrera, Antonio/0000-0003-1990-9292"			Evolution of near-surface ramp-flat-ramp normal faults and implication during intramontane basin formation in the eastern Betic Cordillera (the Huercal-Overa Basin, SE Spain)								TECTONICS				31						TC4024	10.1029/2012TC003130			AUG 23 2012	2012	The nucleation, propagation, and associated folding of ramp-flat-ramp normal faults were analyzed from field examples developed in a brittle/ductile multilayer sequence of the Huercal-Overa Basin (SE Spain). Gently dipping sandy silt layers, which display a low cohesive strength (C-0 = 7 kPa, mu = 34 degrees), favor the development of extensional detachments. A tectonic origin instead of a possible gravitational origin is supported by the perpendicularity between the paleoslope direction of the fluvial-deltaic environment inferred from imbricated pebbles, and the senses of movement deduced from fault slicken-lines. The link between high-angle normal faults (HANFs) - formed at different levels in the layered sequence-with horizontal fault segments comes to develop ramp-flat-ramp normal faults with associated roll-over in the hanging wall. Observed extensional duplexes are formed by parallel detachments connected through synthetic Riedel faults. These Riedel faults would produce the back-rotation of the individual blocks (horses), i.e., extensional folding of the originally subhorizontal layers. There is no correlation between the analyzed ramp-flat-ramp normal faults, accommodating south-southeastward extension during Serravallian-lower Tortonian, and either the regional Alpujarride/Nevado-Filabride west-directed extensional shear zone or the top-to-the-north detachments within Alpujarride units, which are clearly sealed by Serravallian-lower Tortonian sediments. Therefore, the studied normal faults are restricted to the brittle/ductile multilayer fluvio/deltaic sequence and accommodate moderate late extension instead of belonging to a large crustal extensional system connected with a regional detachment at depth. Therefore, the basin formed in a moderate crustal thickness context where small and medium-scale extensional systems were subordinate structures. These natural examples support the development of low-angle normal faults at very shallow crustal levels in multilayer sequences with suitable rheological conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0278-7407			WOS:000308065000001	J	"Chacon, Jose; Irigaray, Clemente; El Hamdouni, Rachid; Valverde-Palacios, Ignacio; Valverde-Espinosa, Ignacio; Calvo, Francisco; Jimenez-Peralvarez, Jorge; Chacon, Eva; Fernandez, Paz; Garrido, Jesus; Lamas, Francisco"				"Valverde-Palacios, Ignacio/B-4491-2012; Jimenez-Peralvarez, Jorge/F-6695-2012; Calvo, Francisco/B-7881-2008; Fernandez Oliveras, Paz/K-7618-2014; Garrido Manrique, Jesus/M-4771-2014; Valverde-Espinosa, Ignacio/M-2362-2014"	"Valverde-Palacios, Ignacio/0000-0002-3550-3092; Calvo, Francisco/0000-0002-8804-5507; Garrido Manrique, Jesus/0000-0002-0002-9888; Valverde-Espinosa, Ignacio/0000-0002-5890-2723"			Engineering and Environmental Geology of Granada and its Metropolitan Area (Spain)								ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE				18	3			217	260					Aug-12	2012	Granada and its metropolitan area lie on the eastern edge of a basin where the foothills rise into the adjacent Sierra Nevada (3,482 m). On the west the valley is bordered by several faulted, Quaternary-age alluvial fans and by dissected terraces of the Genil River. Landscape evolution from about Tortonian to Pleistocene time is reflected by relict Quaternary glaciers preserved on a deeply eroded lower Paleozoic terrain and by terrace remnants and channels resulting from rapid Late Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial incision. This particular geological, geomorphic, and active tectonic setting, combined with a Mediterranean climate under continental influence, and the rapid urban development in the last 60 years have increased exposure to several natural hazards. Urban expansion has increased flash-flood and mass-wasting vulnerability, and seismic risk is similarly increasing with the 1884 Andalusian Earthquake (M 6.3), reflecting the last of several large, similar to 500-year recurrence temblors that have affected the area since at least Roman times. Modern Granada and its metropolitan area, with about a half million inhabitants, are currently increasingly challenged by the highest levels of exposure to natural hazards, by strain on traditional society resulting from adapting to the changes produced by the three decades since the advent of democracy (1978) and by the consequences of the deep economic crisis.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1078-7275			WOS:000308205100001	J	"Lee, Wei-Liang; Liou, K.

Satellite pixels with 100% snow cover have been selected to derive the monthly mean snow albedo value, along with aerosol optical depth, surface temperature, and days after snowfall in March and April to perform multiple regression analysis. We show that aerosol optical depth, which generally includes dust and black carbon over the Sierra Nevada as a result of the transpacific transport from East Asia and local sources, represents a significant parameter affecting snow albedo variation, second only to the land surface temperature change. The regression analysis illustrates that a one standard deviation increase in land surface temperature (2.2 K) and aerosol optical depth (0.044) can lead to decreases in snow albedo by 0.038 and 0.026, respectively. This study also shows that approximately 26% of snow albedo reduction from March to April over the Sierra Nevada is caused by an increase in aerosol optical depth, which has a profound impact on available water resources in California. However, the results show that there are no significant trends for snow albedo, surface temperature, and aerosol optical depth of snow-covered areas over the Sierra Nevada Mountain area in this 10-year period.

Their abundance offers the opportunity to establish its origin and to date the ages of acid magmatism and of early deposition ages of metasedimentary host rocks of the orthogneisses, in this complex metamorphosed and deformed during the Alpine Orogeny. Petrography and bulk-rock chemistry indicate that the orthoderivates samples are peraluminous tourmaline leucogranites and strongly peraluminous biotite gneisses. Compositional similarity in different outcrops points to common genetic relationships. Although the studied gneisses are affected by metamorphic and deformational processes their compositional variations may be explained by differing degrees of crustal melting, source heterogeneity or minor feldspar fractionation. Variation in REE contents is attributed to accessory minerals fractionation. The geochemical data show that the protoliths originated by low degree of partial melting of biotite-rich, muscovite-plagioclase-bearing metasediments. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of magmatic zircons from six samples yielded ages between similar to 282 +/- 5 and 295 +/- 3 Ma. Their ages and chemical composition indicate that these intrusive bodies strongly resemble the peraluminous, post-tectonic, leucogranites widespread in the Variscan Orogen, particularly those produced by crustal partial melting of the Central Iberian Zone. Zircons in host pelitic metasediments provide older ages ranging from similar to 336 to 2.050 Ma. They testify to the recycling of Early Carboniferous and older granites, which are found in the Central Iberian zones of the Iberian Massif. The new geochronological data combined with detailed field observations allow drafting a new chronostratigraphy of the Nevado-Filabride Complex. Traditionally proposed Triassic ages for the metasedimentary upper series of the complex are not consistent with the ages reported here, which suggests that the entire complex consists of Paleozoic or older rocks. This conclusion has profound implications on the validity of the tectonic subdivisions proposed so far. Metamorphic zircon rims in two gneisses and a pelitic metasediment yield Miocene (17.3 +/- 0.4 Ma) ages in line with what previously proposed for the high-pressure metamorphic peak in the Nevado-Filabride Complex. The new radiometric data moreover confirm independent metamorphic and tectonic evolutions for the Nevado-Filabride and the Alpujarride complexes of the Betic Cordillera. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Following this purpose, in this paper we discuss data from two sources concerning the past evolution of the present-day periglacial environment in the Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula): mountain lake sediments and documentary sources. La Mosca lake sedimentary record provides information about the palaeocological evolution in the MulhacSn cirque over the last three millennia, while documentary sources enable us to reconstruct the landscape evolution in the high lands of this massif over the last eight centuries. During the late Holocene cold and wet phases have favoured the activity of geomorphic processes, with ephemeral development of glaciers in the highest northern cirques, abundance of late-lying snow patches and a decrease of the vegetation cover in the highest catchments. By contrast, warm periods have been more conducive to geomorphic stability, with an extension of the vegetation grass cover, but without glaciers and with a lower density of snow patches in summer. The comparison of the palaeocological evolution and associated palaeoclimatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada with other regional proxies shows evidence of the moderate sensitivity of the geomorphological processes occurring in the massif during the late Holocene with respect to the climate variability prevailing in the Iberian Peninsula and neighbouring areas. According to lake sedimentary records, the 'Little Ice Age' has been the coldest period during the late Holocene. Historical sources suggest a temperature increase of 0.93 degrees C since the middle of the 19th century.									10	0	0	4	1	10			0959-6836			WOS:000306084100007	J	"Gomez-Ortiz, Antonio; Palacios, David; Palade, Bogdan; Vazquez-Selem, Lorenzo; Salvador-Franch, Ferran"				PALACIOS, DAVID/H-3737-2015	PALACIOS, DAVID/0000-0002-8289-0398			The deglaciation of the Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain)								GEOMORPHOLOGY				159				93	105		10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.03.008			JUL 15 2012	2012	Cosmogenic Cl-36 surface exposure dating was carried out on 19 samples from glacially polished bedrock, rock glaciers and moraines of four glaciated valleys with different orientations in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) around Pico del Veleta (37 degrees 3'N 3 degrees 21'W, 3398 m asl). Remains of moraines older than the global Last Glacial Maximum exist, but their poor preservation makes them an unreliable subject for surface exposure dating. Results show that the last local glacial maximum advance took place earlier than the global Last Glacial Maximum, but within the MIS 2, although additional dating is needed to confirm this. Exposure ages from bedrock steps show a general glacier retreat in progress by 15-14 ka. Shortly afterwards an extensive system of rock glaciers formed at the base of the valley headwalls, with the most recent rock glacier lasting until 7 ka ago. From their location, morphology and analysis of other proxies, we interpret their origin as related to the deglaciation process and marked instability of cirque headwalls, rather than to extreme periglacial conditions. A recent similar occurrence was the transformation of the Little Ice Age glacier on the north face of the Pico del Veleta into a rock glacier under temperate high mountain climatic conditions.

(ii) Which taxon or group of taxa could act as biodiversity surrogates? Sampling was carried out in 81 aquatic ecosystems across the six national parks during the summers of 2008-2010. The national parks with the highest richness were Picos de Europa and Cabaneros. Overall, the six parks incorporated 66.2% of the taxa included in the Iberian checklist. Multivariate techniques showed that maximum altitude and the presence of lotic habitats were the most important variables related to different community compositions. The best richness model included the presence of a lotic habitat, together with the percentage of the catchment area with non-irrigated agriculture and siliceous geology. Selecting several diverse lotic and lentic water bodies at different altitudes provides the best way of representing Iberian macroinvertebrate diversity. Coleoptera family richness may be used as a macroinvertebrate biodiversity surrogate in Iberian mountainous protected areas because it displayed the highest correlation with the other taxonomic groups and remaining richness values. Such an indicator could be complemented with the use of Odonata family richness for standing waters. The adequacy of Coleopera and Odonata as biodiversity surrogates should be tested at a wider geographic scale, and other surrogacy concepts (e.g. community composition) considered for assessing the role of this network in the protection of rare and endemic species.

For an efficient use of them, databases have been built following the standards proposed by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), providing a common protocol to query them and make them interoperable. The IRAM 30-m radio telescope, located in Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) is a millimeter wavelength telescope with a constantly renewed, extensive choice of instruments, and capable of covering the frequency range between 80 and 370 GHz. It is continuously producing a large amount of data thanks to the more than 200 scientific projects observed each year. The TAPAS archive at the IRAM 30-m telescope is aimed to provide public access to the headers describing the observations performed with the telescope, according to a defined data policy, making as well the technical data available to the IRAM staff members. A special emphasis has been made to make it Virtual Observatory (VO) compliant, and to offer a VO compliant web interface allowing to make the information available to the scientific community. TAPAS is built using the Django Python framework on top of a relational MySQL database, and is fully integrated with the telescope control system. The TAPAS data model (DM) is based on the Radio Astronomical DAta Model for Single dish radio telescopes (RADAMS), to allow for easy integration into the VO infrastructure. A metadata modeling layer is used by the data-filler to allow an implementation free from assumptions about the control system and the underlying database. TAPAS and its public web interface (http://tapas.iram.es) provides a scalable system that can evolve with new instruments and observing modes. A meta description of the DM has been introduced in TAPAS in order to both avoid undesired coupling between the code and the DM and to provide a better management of the archive. A subset of the header data stored in TAPAS will be made available at the CDS.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0922-6435			WOS:000306545200005	J	"Liao, Jau-Chyn; Valenzuela-Rios, Jose I."

The description of 20 conodont taxa and their stratigraphical distribution permits recognition of two separate time intervals. The older one corresponds to the lower Upper Givetian (Middle Devonian), hermanni to cristatus ectypus zones. The younger interval is uppermost Lower Frasnian to lower Middle Frasnian (Upper Devonian) and is equivalent to MN4MN6 zones. The combination of litho- and conodont biofacies supports the distinction between the Sierra Negra and Renanue Subfacies. Conodont biofacies for the studied interval are partially close to the ones from the Compte Subfacies, but lithofacies are clearly different. This faunal similarity fosters accurate correlation between subfacies and stimulates further research aiming at Devonian Pyrenean basin(s) reconstruction. Additionally, this faunal sequence permits direct comparison with regions located in northern Gondwana and in the Russian platform for part of the interval. Comparison with Laurasia, mainly with the Northwest Territories of Canada and the north-western United States, is also provided. Some taxa are also common with eastern and central Asia (China, Siberia, Tadzhikistan, Afghanistan), Australia and western USA (Nevada).									1	0	0	0	0	1			0031-0239			WOS:000306359300005	J	"Ibanez-Alamo, Juan D.; Soler, Manuel"								EURASIAN SPARROWHAWK (ACCIPITER NISUS) AS PREDATOR OF EURASIAN BLACKBIRD (TURDUS MERULA) NESTS								JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH				46	2			230	232					Jun-12	2012										0	0	0	0	0	0			0892-1016			WOS:000305313200015	J	"Gomez, Jose M.; Perfectti, Francisco"				Perfectti, Francisco/C-5087-2008	Perfectti, Francisco/0000-0002-5551-213X			Fitness consequences of centrality in mutualistic individual-based networks								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				279	1734			1754	1760		10.1098/rspb.2011.2244			MAY 7 2012	2012	The relationships among the members of a population can be visualized using individual networks, where each individual is a node connected to each other by means of links describing the interactions. The centrality of a given node captures its importance within the network. We hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight individual-based networks originated from the interaction between Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks, each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree. The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate for the interacting phenotype of individuals.									11	0	0	10	0	11			0962-8452			WOS:000301981300012	22158957J	"Rodriguez, Ferran A.; Iglesias, Xavier; Feriche, Belen; Calderon, Carmen; Abalos, Xavier; Vazquez, Jairo; Barrero, Anna; Rodriguez, Lara; Hynynen, Esa; Levine, Benjamin D."

Reproduction sites were found only in the Sierra Nevada region where we confirmed reproduction at Puerto de la Ragua, 2000 m asl, known since 2004. A new breeding place was found 11 km east of Puerto de la Ragua at 2150 m asl. Recently other Citril Finch sightings were reported by J. M. Rivas from the western part of Sierra Nevada. It is unknown if reproduction in the Sierra Nevada is a recent phenomenon. Scotch pines with annual seed production and access to water together with microclimatic conditions seem to be important factors for the occurrence of Citril Finches in southern Spain.									0	0		0	0	0			0029-3725			ZOOREC:ZOOR14805035597	J	"Garcia-Jurado, Fatima; de Vicente, Inmaculada; Galotti, Andrea; Reul, Andreas; Jimenez-Gomez, Francisco; Guerrero, Francisco"				"Guerrero, Francisco/E-7704-2012; de Souza, Andrea/F-5656-2012; Reul, Andreas/L-7291-2014; JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/E-7093-2012"	"Reul, Andreas/0000-0002-1951-8948; JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0001-8644-7089"			Effect of Drought Conditions on Plankton Community and on Nutrient Availability in an Oligotrophic High Mountain Lake								ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH				44	1			50	61		10.1657/1938-4246-44.1.50			Feb-12	2012	Natural water level fluctuations (WLFs) are an inherent characteristic of Mediterranean inland waters, which are projected to be amplified by global climate change. La Caldera (Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain) is an oligotrophic high mountain lake (3050 m a.s.l.) that has experienced large fluctuations in water volume (13-100%) during the past 20 years due to irregular annual precipitation patterns (371-1816 mm). Because of the lake's cold and dilute abiotic environment, it is likely susceptible to projected increases in global temperature and represents an ideal sentinel of global change. We analyze the effect of WLFs on water quality and on plankton community in La Caldera to better understand the potential effects of recurrent droughts (3 droughts in a 20-year period) on lake ecology. We have found significantly positive effects of WLFs on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. There was extreme variability in TP concentrations during three recurrent droughts (1995, 1999, and 2005) reflecting sediment resuspension. However, the data also suggest that this was not the only source of phosphorus. Extremely high P-enriched atmospheric dust inputs could have maintained the abnormally high TP in-lake concentrations measured during 2005. The data indicate that recurrent droughts have reduced lake resistance to TP changes but have increased lake resistance to total nitrogen (TN) changes, which supports the idea that a P-enriched atmospheric dust inputs during 2005. An increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN):TP mass ratio after 2005 was observed, revealing a higher ecosystem homeostasis of this ratio.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1523-0430			WOS:000302271600006	J	"Israelevich, P.; Ganor, E.; Alpert, P.; Kishcha, P.; Stupp, A."

The maxima of AOT are used to visualize the transport paths. Saharan dust reaches Europe over the Mediterranean and also by looping back over the Atlantic. In spring, aerosols are observed within a wide range of longitudes in Europe, with the highest AOT over western Europe. This may be partially explained by dust transport to western Europe via the Atlantic route, while to central and eastern Europe, dust is transported over the Mediterranean. During all seasons, dust is transported over the Mediterranean to Europe. In the summer months, aerosols are observed predominantly in central Europe. In autumn, aerosol activity is strongest in eastern Europe. We show that there are local AOT maxima over north Italy, in the Alps, in Spain, southeast of the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, and in the Rila Mountains in Bulgaria. We suggest that these maxima of aerosol concentration appear as the dust-carrying airflow reaches the mountains and slows.									25	0	0	8	0	25			2169-897X			WOS:000299702900005	J	"Garcia-Alix, A.; Delgado Huertas, A.; Martin Suarez, E."

In this paper we discuss a plausible habitat based on stable isotopic analyses of these specimens, dated similar to 40-30 cal ky BP, probably corresponding with the beginning of Heinrich Stadial 4 (HS4) and the end of Heinrich Stadial 3 (HS3). Woolly mammoth remains preserve an accurate isotopic register of past climatic conditions because they needed to ingest large amount of resources daily (water and fresh food), whose isotopic signature, influenced by the environmental conditions, was recorded in their tissues. The delta O-18(w), values of the past meteoric waters (-5.47 parts per thousand to -6.7 parts per thousand vs V-SMOW), calculated from the isotopic composition of teeth enamel, suggest moderate temperatures in comparison with those of similar age recovered in central and northern Europe. Due to its geographic position in southern Europe, our samples recorded the highest delta O-18 of past meteoric waters deduced from mammoth remains in Europe. The difference between these values and those of delta O-18(w) current mean annual precipitation are minimal, contrasting with those of higher latitudes during the end of the last glaciation (similar to 50 to similar to 20 cal ky BP). The isotopic values of nitrogen (10.1 parts per thousand, to 13.2 parts per thousand vs AIR) and carbon (-20.7 to -21.8 parts per thousand vs V-PDB) of collagen show a dry habitat, which occasionally could have been extreme. Taken as a whole, the isotopic results suggest that the studied specimens lived in a very dry steppic area, with moderately cold conditions, contrasting with the wet environment of 'El Padul' peat-bog, and its colder temperatures, due to the influence of glacial conditions of the Sierra Nevada, the highest peninsular mountain range. The described habitat may be sited in a more westerly position than the 'El Padul' peat-bog, and it was warmer and drier than those of contemporaneous European woolly mammoths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Ozone Injury Index (OII) field metric applied to P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi in the USA and adapted to P. uncinata in Spain included chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth. Species-level classifications of AVIRIS and CASI hyperspectral imagery were all near 80% overall accuracy for the target bioindicator species. Combining remote sensing indices with GIS variables related to microsite ozone uptake variability produced improved regressions for Catalonia (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001) and California (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001). Multiple regression models for the ozone injury visual component (VI) alone performed much better than the full OII in Catalonia combining the remote sensing index PRI and a three year average of ambient ozone (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and better still when including GIS variables (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001).

Last of the expeditions of the Greek archaic colonization, the Phocean colonization in the western Mediterranean assumes a particular dimension owing to a real convergence between the strength of the metropolis' maritime activity, the context of Mediterranean exchanges between prexis and emporia and the opening out of new fields of exploration in the outermost West. In pursuance of that settlement in Gaul towards 600 B.C., Marseilles experiences a period of exploitation of the potentialities (VI - V c. B.C.), along the Gallic coasts towards Spain (Tartessos and the silver mines of the Sierra Nevada) with the foundations of Emporion and Mainake and inland, towards the Celtic principalities of the North-East, then as chief interlocutor in southern Gaul. With the foundation of a series of settlements between Iberia and Liguria, in the likeness of the contemporaneous coloniae maritimae civium romanorum, the Hellenistic era is marked by the assertion of the city over its territory in the face of the native populations and, at sea, by the side of Rome opposite the Carthaginians. For all their length of time, it is not always easy to measure the impact of the cultural relationships in the creation of spaces and identities in southern Gaul.

Satellite remote sensing is widely used to find out the evolution of the snow cover extension at medium-large scales. But these techniques pose some constraints if snow is heterogeneously distributed, as they do not correctly represent the physical processes that occur on a smaller scale than the satellite image. In such cases, terrestrial photographs, whose resolution can be more easily adapted to the required resolution for these study cases, are an economic and also efficient alternative. This work presents a methodology for the georeferencing and automatic detection of snow in terrestrial photography, as an alternative to the use of satellite images for the study of the snow cover evolution in small areas. This methodology has been evaluated during the snowmelt period in the spring of 2009 at a study site in Sierra Nevada Natural Park (Southern Spain). The resulting snow maps have been compared with the results available for that period obtained from the analyses of four Landsat images. The results show that the use of Landsat generally overestimated the extension of the snow cover in the study area.

The downward component, emitted by the clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere, is rarely measured, and is still not well understood. In mountainous areas, direct observations are even scarcer and the fitting of existing models is often subjected to local parameterization in order to surplus the particular physics of the atmospheric profiles. The influence of clouds makes it even harder to estimate for all sky conditions. This work presents a long-time continuous dataset of high-resolution longwave radiation measured in a weather station at a height of 2500ma.s.l. in Sierra Nevada, Spain, together with the parameterization of the apparent atmospheric emissivity for clear and cloudy skies resulting from three different schemes. We evaluate the schemes of Brutsaert, and Crawford and Duchon with locally adjusted coefficients and compare them with a completely parametric expression adjusted for these data that takes into account three possible significant atmospheric states related to the cloud cover: clear, completely covered, and partly covered skies. All the parametric expressions are related to the screen-level values of temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation, which can be frequently found in standard weather stations. Unobserved cloudiness measurements needed for Brutsaert scheme for cloudy sky are also parameterized from screen-level measurements. The calibration performed for a 6-yr period at the study site resulted in satisfactory estimations of emissivity for all the analyzed schemes thanks to the local fitting of the parameterizations, with the best achievement found for the completely parametric expression. Further validation of the expressions in two alternative sites showed that the greater accuracy of the latter can also be found in very close sites, while a better performance of the Brutsaert scheme, with a more physical background and the successful parameterization of the clouds effect, is found in nearby sites outside the initial mountain range. The results show the feasibility for the local calibration of expressions to estimate instantaneous atmospheric emissivity for all sky conditions only using surface data, either with a completely parametric scheme if longwave data are available, or through obtaining of locally fitted coefficients for Brutsaert and derived schemes. Nevertheless, the best performance of the first approach would be at the expense of a reduced local applicability.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1027-5606			WOS:000310475400006	S	"Martin-Ruiz, Susana; Aceituno, Francisco J.; Gutierrez Soto, Juan"				"Martin-Ruiz, Susana/B-6768-2013; Gutierrez-Soto, Juan/H-9620-2015"	Gutierrez-Soto, Juan/0000-0001-6736-0551	"Moitinho, A; Alves, J"		Setting up the T35 Telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory for Detecting Variable Stars in Open Clusters								STAR CLUSTERS IN THE ERA OF LARGE SURVEYS: PROCEEDINGS OF SYMPOSIUM 5 OF JENAM 2010		Astrophysics and Space Science Proceedings						261	262		10.1007/978-3-642-22113-2_49			2012	2012	The T35 is a 14 '' telescope installed at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain).

This deformation is controlled by a NNW-SSE compressive regime and an approximate orthogonal tensional regime. The compression produced N70 degrees E to E-W folds of several scales, the Sierra Nevada antiform being the largest one. The tension is accommodated mainly by NW-SE active normal faults, the most notable being the Baza Fault, in the Guadix-Baza Basin, and the Granada, Sierra Elvira-Dilar and Padul-Durcal Faults, in the Granada Basin. In addition, other active faults with different orientations also exist, such as the Alfahuara-Botardo and the Galera faults in the Guadix-Baza Basin, and the Huenes, Obeilar-Pinos Puente and N of Sierra Tejeda Faults in the Granada Basin. Moreover, in several sectors, the presence of orthogonal normal fault sets suggests alternating trends or even radial extension. Slip rates of these active faults, based on geologic markers, vary between 0.06 and 0.5 mm/year. Estimates for the maximum expected magnitude of earthquakes caused by these faults vary between M-W 6.0 and 7.0. The N of Sierra Tejeda and the Baza Faults, the largest faults in the Granada and Guadix-Baza Basins, respectively, have the greatest seismic potential. They could cause events up to a magnitude of M-W 6.5-7.0, although their reference earthquakes, computed for a return period of 475 years, are on the order of M-W 5.0-5.5.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1698-6180			WOS:000306950700013	J	"Azanon, J.

These analyses are especially productive in semiarid areas where tectonic rates are low-to-moderate and Quaternary dating is limited. In this work, we have revisited the most relevant GIS-based methodologies used to assess tectonic activity by using morphometric analyses and we discuss the tectonic implications in two key areas of the central and eastern Betic Cordillera (Sierra Nevada and Sierra Alhamilla regions). In the Sierra Nevada area, the use of geomorphic indexes in the mountain range and in the neighboring Granada and Guadix-Baza basins suggests that all are part of the same SW-directed extensional system. The Granada basin (except in its NE border) subsided during the Late Pleistocene as it is located in the hanging wall of the extensional system. On the other hand, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the NE border of the Granada basin and the Guadix-Baza basin are located in the active uplifted foot wall of the system. Thus, the higher fluvial incision rates in the Guadix-Baza basin can be directly correlated with the most recent uplift history of Sierra Nevada mountain range. In the Sierra Alhamilla region, a geomorphic study shows Late Pleistocene activity along the North Alhamilla Reverse Fault and the dextral transpressive South Gafarillos Fault, two segments of the Polopos Fault Zone, previously considered as an inactive fault.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1698-6180			WOS:000306950700014	J	"Villar-Argaiz, Manuel; Jose Bullejos, Francisco; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa; Antonio Delgado-Molina, Jose; Carrillo, Presentacion"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa/K-2819-2014; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"	"Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa/0000-0003-2440-0765; "			Disentangling food quantity and quality effects in zooplankton response to P-enrichment and UV radiation								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				57	1			235	250		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0235			Jan-12	2012	In a 32-yr record in oligotrophic Lake La Caldera (Sierra Nevada, Spain) biomass of zooplankton was strongly correlated with precipitation, aerosol deposition intensity, and ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The food associated-effects of these factors for zooplankton growth were tested in field-laboratory experiments with the aim of separating the effects of food quantity from those of food quality at low food conditions, where there is good evidence to support the existence of food quality effects. Manipulation of nutrients generated a large food quantity gradient that exerted the strongest effect on zooplankton growth, with no significant role of UVR. Growth curves were fitted to a saturation function that reached a plateau at increasing seston levels of ca. 250, 500, and 1000 mu g C L-1 for the rotifer Keratella cochlearis, the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus, and the cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria, respectively, and after which growth decreased in M. laciniatus. Nutrients and to a lesser extent UVR also affected seston quality, which had a minor effect on zooplankton growth. K. cochlearis growth was strongly related to the P content of seston, whereas M. laciniatus and D. pulicaria growth were positively correlated with a P-normalized omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acid index (omega 3-PUFA:P). The increase in seston associated with more intense and frequent atmospheric depositions would adversely affect copepods, but improve growth of C-limited cladocerans and P-limited rotifers in pristine ecosystems of the Mediterranean region.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0024-3590			WOS:000302612100002	J	"Alvarez-Ortega, Sergio; Pena-Santiago, Reyes"					"Pena Santiago, Reyes/0000-0003-1125-5490; Alvarez-Ortega, Sergio/0000-0003-2077-5041"			Nematodes of the order Dorylaimida from Andalucia Oriental, Spain.

The earliest part of the record, from 8200 to about 7000 cal yr BP, is characterized by the highest abundance of arboreal pollen and Pediastrum, indicating the warmest and wettest conditions in the area at that time. The pollen record shows a progressive aridification since 7000 cal yr BP that occurred in two steps, first shown by a decrease in Pinus, replaced by Poaceae from 7000 to 4600 cal yr BP and then by Cyperaceae, Artemisia and Amaranthaceae from 4600 to 1200 cal yr BP. Pediastrum also decreased progressively and totally disappeared at ca. 3000 yr ago. The progressive aridification is punctuated by periodically enhanced drought at ca. 6500, 5200 and 4000 cal yr BP that coincide in timing and duration with well-known dry events in the Mediterranean and other areas. Since 1200 cal yr BP, several changes are observed in the vegetation that probably indicate the high-impact of humans in the Sierra Nevada, with pasturing leading to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the bog, Pinus reforestation and Olea cultivation at lower elevations.

Low-angle normal faults have been responsible for the exhumation of the metamorphic rocks constituting the Internal Zone or Alboran domain, as well as for the formation of sedimentary basins, commonly referred to as Betic intramontane basins.The Betic intramontane basins are located either on the Alboran domain or at the contact between the Alboran domain and the External Zone. All of these basins have a common sedimentary evolution, characterized by three main sequences separated by unconformities of regional significance. The lower (Upper Serravallian-Lower Tortonian) and upper sequences (uppermost Tortonian-Pleistocene) consist of continental clastic sedimentary rocks. The intermediate sequence (Upper-Tortonian-Upper Messinian) is made of marine sedimentary rocks, representing a very short-lived diachronic inundation, which lasted longer in the eastern and southern parts of the Betics. Subsidence rates in the basins reached maximum values during Late Serravallian-Early Tortonian times (13-7 Ma), and gradually decreased toward Pleistocene time. Uplift in the sierras surrounding the basins was roughly in accordance with the subsidence in the basins.The onset of subsidence of the Betic intramontane basins was coeval with the onset of extension in the deeper tectonometamorphic units of the Alboran domain, in Late Serravallian-Early Tortonian times. From latemost Tortonian on, the Africa-Europe convergence direction changed, giving way to E-W trending compressional folds, NW-SE oriented high-angle normal faults, as well as E-W and NE-SW trending strike-slip faults. These structures deformed the basins and their basements in a complex way, with coeval compression, exhumation and extension. Later on, strike-slip faults strongly affected some of the basin margins, obliterating the previous extensional structures. A lithosphere-scale scenario characterized by mantle delamination and/or subduction roll-back/slab-detachment provides the framework to explain the Betic intramontane basins.									2	0	0	0	0	2					"978-1-4443-4713-5; 978-1-4051-9465-5"	WOS:000336999700024	J	"Cepak, Vladislav; Lukavsky, Jaromir"				"Lukavsky, Jaromir/H-1607-2014; Cepak, Vladislav/H-1581-2014"				Cryoseston in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain)								NOVA HEDWIGIA				94	01-Feb			163	173		10.1127/0029-5035/2012/0094-0163			Dec-11	2011	Coloured snow fields in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain) were studied, and thirty two cryoseston samples were collected from the central region of these mountains, on the southern slopes of Mulhacen and the northern slopes of Pico de Veleta (altitudes from ca 2500 m above sea level).

The mapping process developed to store data about vegetation and flora in the upper vegetation belt of Sierra Nevada (South-Eastern Spain) is shown. The aim was to elaborate a detailed cartography that served into future to detect changes in plant communities. The extension of the crioromediterranean belt was estimated in 3875.7 ha, ranging between 2750-3290 m of altitude.

Decomposition experiments with alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaf litter were carried out in 22 headwater streams in 4 different climatic regions across the Iberian Peninsula (Cornisa Cantabrica, Cordillera Litoral Catalana, Sierra de Guadarrama, and Sierra Nevada). Streams that were similar in size, flowed mainly over siliceous substrate in catchments with scarce human settlements and activities, and fell within a range of low nutrient concentrations were chosen in each region. Breakdown rates were regionally variable and were low (0.109-0.198% ash-free dry mass [AFDM]/degree day [dd]) in the Cornisa Cantabrica, the most mesic and Atlantic region, and high (0.302-0.639% AFDM/dd) in Sierra de Guadarrama, one of the coldest and most inland areas. Temperature was not the determining factor affecting differences in breakdown rates among regions, and breakdown rates were not related to concentrations of dissolved nutrients. However, microbial reproductive activity (sporulation rates) was significantly correlated with dissolved P concentration. Breakdown rates were explained better by presence and feeding activities of detritivores than by decomposer activity. Incorporation of breakdown rates in assessment schemes of stream ecological status will be difficult because leaf processing does not respond unequivocally to environmental factors when climatic regions are considered. Thus, regional adjustments of baseline standards in reference conditions will be required.									22	1	0	20	0	23			0887-3593			WOS:000298218600006	J	"Casas, J.

Scant information is available on leaf breakdown in streams of arid and semiarid regions, including the Mediterranean, where environmental heterogeneity can be high and the relationship between stream characteristics and leaf breakdown is poorly known. We tested the hypotheses that differences in leaf breakdown metrics would be substantially higher between mountain and lowland Mediterranean streams than among streams within each subregion and that variability among streams would be substantially higher in the lowlands, because permanent reaches in the semiarid lowland streams are rare and isolated.2. We compared leaf breakdown and associated dynamics of nutrients, fungi and invertebrates in low-order Mediterranean streams draining sub-humid forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and nearby semiarid lowlands of south-eastern Spain. Streams differed between the two subregions mainly in water ion content, temperature and riparian tree cover. We detected higher environmental heterogeneity among streams within the lowlands compared to the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In the lowlands, breakdown coefficients (k) of alder leaves spanned almost the entire range reported for this species from temperate streams, overlapping with less variable breakdown coefficients in the Sierra Nevada.3. The high variability of k values among the lowland sites appeared to be caused primarily by variability in the composition and abundance of a few leaf-consuming invertebrate taxa, particularly the snail Melanopsis praemorsa. Fungal and nutrient dynamics were less variable among sites within each subregion.4. These results indicate that the critical condition for stream functional assessment of well-constrained breakdown rates, or related metrics, could be met at reference sites within homogenous bio-geo-climatic regions such as the Sierra Nevada. By contrast, in heterogeneous areas such as the semiarid lowland streams, natural variability of breakdown rates can greatly exceed the magnitude of effects expected in response to anthropogenic disturbances.									5	0	0	5	1	6			0046-5070			WOS:000296502000014	J	"Schank, C.

Most of the markers successfully amplified in other Erysimum species.Conclusions : The genetic attributes of microsatellite loci will allow their application to population genetic studies in Erysimum, such as genetic differentiation and structure, gene flow, pollinator-mediated speciation, and hybridization studies.									1	0	0	1	0	1			Feb-22			WOS:000295888800009	21940811J	"Benito, Blas; Lorite, Juan; Penas, Julio"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Benito, Blas M./D-4681-2014; Penas, Julio/N-4885-2014"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Benito, Blas M./0000-0001-5105-7232; Penas, Julio/0000-0001-6102-4610"			Simulating potential effects of climatic warming on altitudinal patterns of key species in Mediterranean-alpine ecosystems								CLIMATIC CHANGE				108	3			471	483		10.1007/s10584-010-0015-3			Oct-11	2011	In this paper we study an isolated high-mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Iberian Peninsula) to identify the potential trends in the habitat-suitability of five key species (i.e. species that domain a given vegetation type and drive the conditions for appearance of many other species) corresponding to four vegetation types occupying different altitudinal belts, that might result from a sudden climatic shift. We used topographical variables and downscaled climate warming simulations to build a high-resolution spatial database (10 m) according to four different climate warming scenarios for the twenty-first century. The spatial changes in the suitable habitat were simulated using a species distribution model, in order to analyze altitudinal shifts and potential habitat loss of the key species. Thus, the advance and receding fronts of known occurrence locations were computed by introducing a new concept named differential suitability, and potential patterns of substitution among the key species were established. The average mean temperature trend show an increase of 4.8A degrees C, which will induce the vertical shift of the suitable habitat for all the five key species considered at an average rate of 11.57 m/year. According to the simulations, the suitable habitat for the key species inhabiting the summit area, where most of the endemic and/or rare species are located, may disappear before the middle of the century. The other key species considered show moderate to drastic suitable habitat loss depending on the considered scenario. Climate warming should provoke a strong substitution dynamics between species, increasing spatial competition between both of them. In this study, we introduce the application of differential suitability concept into the analysis of potential impact of climate change, forest management and environmental monitoring, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties of these simulations.									14	0	0	14	0	15			0165-0009			WOS:000295033800005	J	De Freina, Josef J.

Recent field observations as well as rearings revealed supplementary information on preimaginal instars, cocoon characters, habitat preference and foodplants. An account of the poorly known life cycle of the complex of H. paradoxa is given; larva, hibernaculum, cocoons of both genders, male antennal structure, larval host plants and characteristic habitats of its infraspecific taxa are illustrated. The paradoxa-complex is recognized as a group of localised populations in isolated colonies, which are in the process of speciation. They are ecologically well-adapted and do not move far from their natural habitat. It is restricted to Cantabria, the western half and centre of the Iberian peninsula, northern Portugal and Andalusia. A critical evaluation of reliable characters in the imagines of H. paradoxa and their biology revealed two apparently distinct subspecies: H. paradoxa paradoxa (a neotype ' is designated from Spain, Sierra Nevada, Pto. del Lobo, deposited in ZSM), and H. paradoxa bejarensis CHAPMAN, 1902 stat. rev. from Central Spain. Both are shown to be geographically and thus reproductively isolated from each other. Another remarkable heterogeneity was found between H. paradoxa and populations of the Cantabrian mountain range. The morphological differences between these populations and the known samples of the complex of H. paradoxa as well as its ecological adaptation are interpreted as characterising a distinct species, herein described as H. yerayi sp. n. (holotype [male] via CdFM in coll. Museum Witt, Munchen, and eventually in ZSM). The relationship of H. jellaba DE FREINA, 2003 and H. rifensis DE FREINA, 2003 to the paradoxa-group is discussed. The taxon H. penella ucedinis CHAPMAN, 1907 is shown to be a nomen dubium."									2	0	0	2	0	2			0723-9912			ZOOREC:ZOOR14711078739	J	"Oliva, Marc; Schulte, Lothar; Gomez Ortiz, Antonio"								The role of aridification in constraining the elevation range of Holocene solifluction processes and associated landforms in the periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain)								EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS				36	10			1279	1291		10.1002/esp.2116			Aug-11	2011	Climate variability during the Mid-Late Holocene has influenced the activity of geomorphic processes in the current periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada. We studied two types of sedimentary records that reveal a synchronous timing for slope instability in this high semi-arid massif: solifluction landforms and mountain lake sediments. Lithological and sedimentological properties of both records have recorded numerous cycles of different magnitude of slope processes in the massif. Solifluction deposits record seven phases of solifluction activity and soil development during the last 7 ka BP and lake sediments show evidence of eight periods with increased geomorphic activity in the catchments over the last 6 ka BP. Although present-day climate conditions do not promote active solifluction processes in the Sierra Nevada, colder and wetter periods during the Holocene triggered solifluction and transported coarse-grained sediments into the lakes. By contrast, warm phases favoured soil formation and spread an incipient vegetation cover over the headwaters of the highest valleys, diminishing the grain size of the particles reaching the lakes. Lake sediments record an aridification trend in the massif intensifying since 4.2 ka BP that has conditioned solifluction activity to shift gradually to higher elevations. During major cooler phases such as the Little Ice Age active solifluction was recorded back down to 2500 m altitude.

Apatite (U-Th)/He ages are close to fission-track ages in western Sierra Nevada indicating that rapid cooling occurred at 8-6 Ma, consistent with exhumation due to extension along the Mecina Fault. The western Sierra de los Filabres cooled rapidly at c. 12 Ma, while the central Sierra de los Filabres experienced less rapid cooling at 8 Ma. The age distribution in the Sierra de los Filabres can be explained by exhumation due to flexural uplift to the south-west of the footwall of the Mecina Fault. The lower cooling rates in the central Sierra de los Filabres suggest that folding and erosion were the main exhumation processes during the Late Tortonian.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0954-4879			WOS:000292563900005	J	"Teresa Vizoso, Maria; Bruno Navarro, Francisco; Lorite, Juan"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Navarro, Francisco/M-2882-2014"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Navarro, Francisco/0000-0001-8782-6873"			Thymus x pseudogranatensis (Labiatae), a new hybrid from Sierra Nevada (Spain)								ANALES DEL JARDIN BOTANICO DE MADRID				68	2			161	166		10.3989/ajbm.2281			JUL-DEC 2011	2011	Vizoso, M.

The results based on genetic analyses at the population level (AMOVA, genetic diversity, genetic distance) and genetic and morphological analyses at individual level (haplotype phenetic distance, PCO, morphometrics) indicate that: (1) genetic diversity decreases with altitude, probably as a result of the postglacial recolonization processes, except in some secondary contact zones between taxa; (2) gene flow among interspecific populations, most likely facilitated by contraction of vegetation belts, led to the formation of hybrid taxa; (3) genetic distances among populations provide a useful basis for studying scenarios with frequent interspecific gene-flow since it allows distinguishing eventual cases of introgression from hybridogenous taxa."									7	0	0	7	0	7			0211-1322			WOS:000298355600005	J	"Bagne, Karen E.; Purcell, Kathryn L."

We examined effects of low-severity prescribed fires on counts of birds in a managed forest in the Sierra Nevada of California immediately, 1 year, and 3-6 years after fire was applied in spring. Of 26 species analyzed, counts of 3 species increased after fire (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], and American robin [Turdus migratorius]), and 6 species decreased after fire (Anna's hummingbird [Calypte anna], Hutton's vireo [Vireo huttoni], warbling vireo [Vireo gilvus], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], Nashville warbler [Vermivora ruficapilla], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]). Black-throated gray warbler (Dendroica nigrescens) increased in the first year following fire but decreased 3-6 years after fire. When grouped into guilds, habitat association and foraging guild best explained responses to fire, with the greatest changes occurring for oak-associated species (negative), riparian-associated species (positive), aerial foragers (positive), and bark foragers (positive). Lastly, when we compared our counts to those collected during the 1910s, changes were consistent with those predicted from fire suppression and species' affinity for burned forests, suggesting that results from contemporary fire studies should be interpreted within an ecological context that includes effects of fire suppression. We found that low-severity prescribed fires applied in spring served to drive the bird community towards pre-suppression conditions.

Prediction of the probability of fire-injured tree mortality is critical for management of burned areas, evaluation of the ecological and economic impact of wildfire and prescribed fire planning and application. Pine bark beetles (Scolytidae) frequently attack burned maritime pine stands and cause extensive post-fire mortality throughout the Iberian Peninsula. In the present study, maritime pine trees were monitored for three years following 14 wildfires in four ecotypes in Spain (11 fires in Galicia (Galician ecotype NW Spain), one fire in Portillo (Meseta-Castellana ecotype - Central Spain), one fire in Rodenal (Rodenal ecotype - Central Spain), and one fire in Genalguacil (Sierra Bermeja ecotype - SW Spain)). Data on tree attributes, crown and bole injury, ground fire severity, Ips sp. presence and tree survival were obtained by examining 3085 trees. Logistic regression models for predicting the probability of delayed maritime pine mortality were developed by use of generalized estimated equations (GEE). An ample range of response to fire damage in mortality was evident among the four ecotypes and different models were fitted for each. The most important variables for predicting tree mortality were total crown volume damaged, presence of Ips sp. attack and cambium kill rating. The results highlight the extensive presence of Ips sp. in burned maritime pine forests and its importance in tree mortality process, the ample range of response of P. pinaster, in terms of post-fire mortality, as well as the need to develop site specific mortality models for the different ecotypes of this species following fire.

The range was extensively glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline - Laguna de Rio Seco at 3020 m elevation - in a paleoecological study documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, fire and climate change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that pine trees grew around the lake, and fire was relatively unimportant at this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Rio Seco occurred before 7800 cal yr BR This is in contrast to lower elevation sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000 cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Rio Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus. Artemisia, and others). The disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand, Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Rio Seco record after ca 4000 cal yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations, fire occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record confirms that even remote sites were not free of direct human influence during the Holocene.

The study was performed over two consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. Both years were characterised by strong differences associated with rainfall patterns. The first year was extremely dry and had rainfall values far below the mean annual average of 813 mm that has been observed over the previous twenty years. The results of the study confirm that the dissolved inorganic nitrogen:soluble reactive phosphorus ratio (DIN:SRP) showed notable differences throughout both study years, with a greater nitrogen limitation during 2005. The ratio of total biovolume of autotrophic to heterotrophic organisms (A:H) also presented interannual differences. The A:H ratio was generally below 1 during 2005, whereas it was above this value in 2006. Therefore, the main plankton component was mesozooplankton in 2005 and phytoplankton in 2006. Ciliates and bacteria showed a mean biovolume significantly higher in 2005, whereas the biovolume of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was similar during both years.

In a study area of 460 km 2, 252 landslides were inventoried, affecting 3.2% of the total surface area. These landslides were mainly slides and flows on phyllite, schist and marble units in the Inner Zone of the Betic Cordillera. The most relevant determining factors proved to be elevation, slope angle, slope aspect and lithology. Triggering factors include mainly short-term landslide generation during heavy rainfall, as well as sporadic earthquakes or long-term activation by land-use changes, river over-excavation, etc. Although landslide susceptibility, assessed by the GIS matrix method, is predominantly low, some 15% of the study area shows moderate to very high susceptibility, coinciding with the sites of public works in the region. The map drawn was validated by the degree-of-fit method, registering values above 83.2% for the zones of high and very high susceptibility.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1435-9529			WOS:000293184600011	J	"Gonzalez-Megias, Adela; Maria Gomez, Jose; Sanchez-Pinero, Francisco"				Sanchez Pinero, Francisco/L-2629-2014				Spatio-temporal change in the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species diversity								ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				37	3			179	186		10.1016/j.actao.2011.01.011			MAY-JUN 2011	2011	"Beta diversity plays an important role in mediating species diversity and therefore improves our understanding of species-diversity patterns. One principal theoretical framework exists for such patterns, the ""habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis (HHH)"", which postulates a positive relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. Although HHH is widely accepted, spatial and temporal variability has been found in the relationship between diversity and heterogeneity. Species turnover has been proposed as the main factor explaining spatial variation in the relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. In this study, we tested the role of species turnover in explaining spatial and temporal variability on diversity-heterogeneity relationship in a Mediterranean ecosystem, using beetles as the study organisms. A hierarchical design including different habitats and years was used to test our hypothesis. Using different multivariate analyses, we tested for spatial and temporal variability in beta diversity, and in the beetle diversity-heterogeneity relationship using two diversity indices. Our study showed that beetle composition changed spatially and temporally, although temporal change was evident only between sampling periods but not between years. Notably, there was spatial and temporal change in the relationship between habitat descriptors and beetle diversity. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the changes in beetle composition with the changes in the habitat-heterogeneity relationships. In this Mediterranean system, spatial and temporal changes in the diversity-heterogeneity relationships cannot be predicted by species turnover, and other mechanisms need to be explored to satisfactorily explain this variability.

Therefore, three size fractions (1-2,0.25-1, and 0.05-0.25 mm) of 25 topsoils (75 samples) from a Regosol-Umbrisol soilscape (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain) were characterized for fabric by scanning electron microscopy, aggregate stability by wet sieving, and CIELAB color (h(ab), L*, C*(ab)) by diffuse spectral reflectance. A stability-index ranking from 0.17 to 0.98 paralleled a ranking of hat, (88.5 to 66.1), L* (48.3 to 30.2), and C*(ab) (7.6 to 18.9): that is, the progressive increase in stability was related to increased soil redness, darkness, and chromaticity. The reason was an increase in binding agents such as clay, organic C, and free forms coating the surfaces of the aggregates. The values of the correlation coefficients (0.55 to 0.82), factor-analysis variances (73 to 88%), and multiple-regression coefficients (0.40 to 0.65) indicated, however, that much of the variability in stability cannot be statistically explained by color changes. Size fractions of soils with a similar binding-agent content did not significantly (P<0.05) differ in color but they did in aggregate stability. They also showed fabric differences, indicating that the coatings are similarly effective as coloring, while their stabilizing capacity is regulated by size, shape, and arrangement of particles. A close packing of mixed silt sizes stacked like roof tiles resulted in a stable fabric itself. Color can indicate aggregate stability, depending on the binding-agent content, but, being insensitive to the inner particle arrangement, it cannot provide a complete prediction.

To experimentally analyze the effect on soil respiration, we manipulated a recently burned pine forest in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada National and Natural Park, SE Spain). Three representative treatments of post-fire burnt wood management were established at two elevations: (1) ""salvage logging"" (SL), where all trees were cut, trunks removed, and branches chipped; (2) ""non-intervention"" (NI), leaving all burnt trees standing; and (3) ""cut plus lopping"" (CL), a treatment where burnt trees were felled, with the main branches lopped off, but left in situ partially covering the ground surface. Seasonal measurements were carried out over the course of two years. In addition, we performed continuous diurnal campaigns and an irrigation experiment to ascertain the roles of soil temperature and moisture in determining CO2 fluxes across treatments. Soil CO2 fluxes were highest in CL (average of 3.34 +/- 0.191 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and the lowest in SL (2.21 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Across seasons, basal values were registered during summer (average of 1.46 +/- 0.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), but increased during the humid seasons (up to 10.07 +/- 1.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in spring in CL). Seasonal and treatment patterns were consistent at the two elevations (1477 and 2317 m a.s.l.), although respiration was half as high at the higher altitude.Respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture. Watering during the summer drought boosted CO2 effluxes (up to 37 +/- 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) just after water addition), which then decreased to basal values as the soil dried. About 64% of CO2 emissions during the first 24 h could be attributed to the degasification of soil pores, with the rest likely related to biological processes.

Aerosol columnar properties retrieved by sun photometry represent a large dataset of information about the physical and light absorbing and scattering properties of the total aerosol, but lack more detailed chemical information about the organic fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. To obtain additional information about relationships between organic aerosol sources and columnar properties, we simultaneously examined stable isotope properties of PM10 aerosols from urban (Granada, Spain) and remote (Sierra Nevada, Spain) sites and diesel exhaust, spectroscopic properties of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) of PA(10) aerosols, and sun photometry measurements. We demonstrated that C and N stable isotopes and parameters from UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy are able to discriminate between aerosols receiving substantial fossil fuel pollution and those influenced by Saharan dust in an urban area. More depleted delta C-13 was associated with low asymmetry parameter, g(lambda), and high values of the spectral slope ratio, S-R, were associated with high effective radius, typical of pollution situations. The humification index (HIX), used predominantly to evaluate the degree of organic matter humification, was significantly related to g(lambda), and the radius of fine mode particles, r(f) and may reflect aging of the Saharan dust-influenced aerosols. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling identified a fluorescent component (C3) with a spectrum similar to that of naphthalene, which was significantly related to g(lambda), and rf. The diesel exhaust sample represented a pollution end-member, with the lightest delta C-13 value (-26.4 parts per thousand,), lowest S-R (0.95), lowest HIX (2.77) and highest %C3 (20%) of all samples.

As well, the surface area of skin with scabietic lesions estimated during field surveys were compared with measurements taken in the laboratory and the potential for using categories based on surface areas estimated during monitoring and management programs was analyzed. The surface area of the skin lesions measured in the laboratory and the time of year were the main factors affecting mite load. Results also revealed discrepancies between the surface area of lesions estimated in the field and those measured in the laboratory. The highest error percentages were associated with lesions ranging between 25 and 75% of host skin surface area. By reducing the number of categories of mange infestation (from 5 to 3) the proportion of cases correctly classified using data from field surveys increases. Our analyses suggest that the estimated surface areas of scabietic lesions is a useful relative index of mite abundance and/or intensity of parasitation in Iberian wild goat. Therefore, we conclude that revised classifications should be used in the monitoring of sarcoptic mange in wild populations, since data can be obtained in an inexpensive, fast and non-invasive fashion.

There is a clear influence of ambient temperature on all the profiles, with a lag time of two to five months. Nevertheless, there are clear differences in the temperature depth profile patterns that can be accounted for by other factors. First, there is a greater influence of localized recharge; Guadalfeo River as opposed to diffuse recharge; irrigation return flow and rainfall. Three of the wells located near the riverbed of the Guadalfeo River have extremely variable temperature-depth profiles and show clear river influence. In springtime, during the highest flood stages of the river due to cold melt water from the Sierra Nevada, the groundwater falls in temperature. During secondary peaks in river flow rates during the autumn due to rainfall, the warm water increases groundwater temperature. The effect of the river recharge decreases with distance from the course since there is less mixing with water from the Guadalfeo River. In addition, there are two temperature-depth profiles in which temperature variations remain shallow and follow a pattern that cannot be attributed to the influence of either of the above two parameters. Among these two cases, the most influential factor is the groundwater flow pattern typical of a discharge zone, characterized by vertical-flow components."									7	0	0	0	0	7			1735-1472			WOS:000287841400001	J	"El Mouden, E.

This is the result of the direct destruction or alteration of reproductive cell lineages (parasitic castration sensu stricto), or the indirect detrimental effects - for example, via body condition - on the ability of progenitors to produce or rear offspring (parasitic castration sensu lato). There are enormous gaps in our knowledge on the effects of parasites on the testes of wild mammals and in an attempt to rectify this dearth of data we examined the relationship between the skin parasite Sarcoptes scabiei and testes mass in Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica. We considered data from 222 males that were culled in the population from the Sierra Nevada in Spain. Our results provide evidence that sarcoptic mange is associated with reduced size-corrected testes mass in Iberian ibex which supports the hypothesis that parasitism is a determining factor in gonad plasticity in male mammals. We discuss several hypothetical causes of this relationship and highlight the need to deepen the sub-lethal effects of pathogens if we are to accurately understand their modulator effects on host population dynamics.

Despite the fact that body stores in both sexes were highest during the warmest months of the year and lowest during the coldest months when food resources are limited, the observed pattern was sex- and age-dependent. The KFs of male goats fell more than those of females in winter, and the yearlings of both sexes needed one season more than young or adults to restore their KFs. Goats of all age classes showed the same seasonal patterns in their Ks, although Ks were lower in females than in males throughout the yearly cycle. In addition, we found strong delayed effects of both snowfalls and population density on body stores, and in years with a lot of snow, goats' KFs reached their lowest levels in the current winter-spring, but the highest in the following summers and autumns. This pattern was less noticeable in the Ks. Population density negatively affected the body stores of wild goats, especially in winter, and the amount of snow fallen in the year of birth (cohort effect) did not seem to influence the body stores in our data set. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of the residuals from the regression between body size and body mass for monitoring body condition of live wild goats and concluded that, although it poorly indicates fat stores, it could be used as a general proxy of body condition. Finally, we discuss the expected effects of climate warming on body stores in this Mediterranean Caprinae species.									8	0	0	5	0	8			1612-4642			WOS:000286630300005	S	"Herrero, Javier; Polo, Maria J.; Losada, Miguel A."

Located in the South, facing the Mediterranean Sea in a distance of less than 40 km, the high level of solar energy income throughout the year, together with the extremely variable character of climate in such latitudes, make it necessary to use energy balance approaches to characterize the snow cover evolution. Wind and relative humidity become decisive factors in the evolution of the snow cover due to the high evaporation rates that can arise under favourable meteorological conditions. This work presents the enhanced capability of the combination of Landsat TM data with the simulation of an energy balance model to produce sequences of hourly high resolution maps of snow cover and depth distribution under variable meteorological conditions such as those found in Mediterranean mountainous watersheds. Despite the good agreement found between observed and predicted snow pixels, different examples of disagreement arose in the boundaries, most of them related to the temperature and wind speed spatial pattern simulation together with the discrimination between rain and snowfall occurrence.

Perhaps it is replaced by another subspecies in Sierra Nevada above 2 500 m, and perhaps it is another subspecies who lives on the French territory and in the Iberian pre-Pyrenees. C. binotatus is surely represented by the subspecies C. binotatus atlasi Defaut 1987 in the Northern Middle-Atlas (Morocco), taxon which perhaps can to be elevated to the rank of species. 3) The nominative subspecies Chorthippus saulcyi saulcyi (Krauss, 1888), new combination occupies almost all of the French Department of Pyrenees-Orientales and the major part of the Iberian Catalan Pyrenees, in altitude. It is replaced by Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) moralesi Uvarov, 1954, new combination in the NW of the Catalan Pyrenees, the French and Spanish Cerdagne and the Aragonese Pyrenees. On the French side of the Pyrenees the nominative subspecies is replaced by Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) vicdessossi Defaut, ssp. new, since the boundary betwwen Aude and Ariege depratments up to natural reserve of Neouvielle (Hautes-Pyrenees), at least. Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) daimei (Azam 1893), new combination is found in the Alps. 4) The cevenol micropterous taxon is attached here to C. saulcyi : Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) algoaldensis Chopard 1952, new combination, but this is entirely provisional because several elements lead to see a micropterous subspecies of Chorthippus binotatus, while others elements could make it a valid species. 5) The apparent parapatry of the three Pyrenean subspecies of Chorthippus saulcyi (C. s. saulcyi, C. s. vicdessossi and C. s. moralesi) is problematic; for further taxonomic understanding it will be necessary to carefully study the contact zones, and to complete by a biometric study and a study of acoustic behavior, or even a study of molecular biology, studies should be extended also to the forms of the Alps and Cevennes"									0	0		0	0	0			1764-6308			ZOOREC:ZOOR14712081938	J	"Cleve, Casey; Perrine, John; Holzman, Barbara; Hines, Ellen"								Addressing biased occurrence data in predicting potential Sierra Nevada red fox habitat for survey prioritization								Endangered Species Research				14	3			179	191		10.3354/esr00348			2011	2011	The Sierra Nevada red fox Vulpes vulpes necator is listed as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act. It originally occurred throughout California's Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain regions. Its current distribution is unknown but should be determined in order to guide management actions. We used occurrence data from the only known population, in the Lassen Peak region of northern California, combined with climatic and remotely sensed variables, to predict the species' potential distribution throughout its historic range. These model predictions can guide future surveys to locate additional fox populations. Moreover, they allow us to compare the relative performances of presence-absence (logistic regression) and presence-only (maximum entropy, or Maxent) modeling approaches using occurrence data with potential false absences and geographical biases. We also evaluated the recently revised Maxent algorithm that reduces the effect of geographically biased occurrence data by subsetting background pixels to match biases in the occurrence data. Within the Lassen Peak region, all models had good fit to the test data, with high values for the true skill statistic (76-83%), percent correctly classified (86-92%), and area under the curve (0.94-0.96), with Maxent models yielding slightly higher values. Outside the Lassen Peak region, the logistic regression model yielded the highest predictive performance, providing the closest match to the fox's historic range and also predicting a site where red foxes were subsequently detected in autumn 2010. Subsetting background pixels in Maxent reduced but did not eliminate the effect that geographically biased occurrence data had on prediction results relative to the Maxent model using full background pixels.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1863-5407	1613-4796		BCI:BCI201100669497	J	"Conde-Porcuna, Jose M.; Javier Valdes, Francisco; Romo, Susana; Perez-Martinez, Carmen"				"Conde-Porcuna, Jose/L-9665-2014; Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014"	"Conde-Porcuna, Jose/0000-0002-5074-2796; Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487"			Ephippial and subitaneous egg abortion: relevance for an obligate parthenogenetic Daphnia population								JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY				70	1			69	75		10.3274/JL11-70-1-09			2011	2011	"We experimentally analysed the importance of egg abortion in the reproduction strategies of Daphnia pulicaria (Forbes) in Lake Rio Seco, a high mountain lake. Adult animals were exposed to different treatments under continuous or dynamic conditions (temperature and photoperiod) to test whether the simulation of field conditions, with changing temperature and photoperiod, induces differences in their reproductive traits in comparison to continuous conditions, with the aim of extrapolating results to the lake. Continuous conditions were the photoperiod and temperature values recorded in the lake at the time when ephippial reproduction is induced. Dynamic conditions were the changing values in the field from the continuous conditions until autumn. The number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium was also recorded by using sediment traps in the lake. Our results show that subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion has a major influence on an obligate parthenogenetic Daphnia population in both the laboratory and field. The total number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium (mean +/- SE; 0.52 +/- 0.12) and the proportion of released empty ephippia obtained in the sediment traps (0.73 +/- 0.05) were similar to those experimentally obtained under dynamic conditions (healthy eggs per ephippium: 0.29 +/- 0.16; proportion of released empty ephippia: 0.79 +/- 0.11), suggesting that ephippial egg abortion and empty ephippia production are frequent in nature. This is the first study to describe Daphnia ephippial egg abortion and compare subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion between experimental and field conditions.

This paper discusses research aiming at the development of methods and tools that can be used for enhanced integration of forest and fire management planning activities. Specifically, fire damage models were developed for Eucalyptus globulus Labill stands in Portugal. Models are based on easily measurable forest characteristics so that forest managers may predict post-fire mortality based on forest structure. For this purpose, biometric data and fire-damage descriptors from 2005/2006 National Forest Inventory plots and other sample plots within 2006, 2007 and 2008 fire areas were used. A three-step modelling strategy based on logistic regression methods was used. In the first step, a model was developed to predict whether mortality occurs after a wildfire in a eucalypt stand. In the second step the degree of damage caused by wildfires in stands where mortality occurs is quantified (i.e. percentage of mortality). In the third step this mortality is distributed among trees. Data from over 85 plots and 1648 trees were used for modeling purposes. The damage models show that relative damage increases with stand basal area. Tree level mortality models indicate that trees with high diameters, in dominant positions and located in regular stands are less prone to die when a wildfire occurs.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0037-5330	2242-4075		WOS:000291081000005	J	"Penas, Julio; Lorite, Juan; Alba-Sanchez, Francisca; Angelica Taisma, Maria"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Penas, Julio/N-4885-2014"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Penas, Julio/0000-0001-6102-4610"			Self-incompatibility, floral parameters, and pollen characterization in the narrow endemic and threatened species Artemisia granatensis (Asteraceae)								ANALES DEL JARDIN BOTANICO DE MADRID				68	1			97	105		10.3989/ajbm.2276			JAN-JUN 2011	2011	Penas, J., Lorite, J., Alba-Sanchez, F. & Taisma, M.

Madrid 68(1): 97-105.Artemisia granatensis Boiss. is a paradigmatic species for plant conservation in Spain and Europe. It is a critically endangered (CR) endemic species growing above 2500 m in the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). Natural populations have been considerably devastated in the past due to intensive human exploitation for folk medicine. The sparse available data concerning the reproductive biology of this species under natural conditions indicate a low reproductive success. To provide additional information on the reproductive biology of A. granatensis, and consequently information useful for the management and conservation of this species, we studied the breeding system through pollen-tube growth. In addition, some floral and pollen traits were recorded. No differences were found between populations in terms of the morphological traits of flowers and inflorescences. A. granatensis is an anemophilous species, and the data indicate that pollen transfer may be limited between isolated populations, and so contributing to an extremely low fruit-set. Results show A. granatensis is self-incompatible, probably with a sporophytic self-incompatibility system, and with no evidence of partial self-incompatibility. Reproductive traits, related to pollen morphology and settling speed may explain the low rate of recruitment in the small populations separated by geographical barriers.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0211-1322			WOS:000292321100005	J	"Fernandez Calzado, Maria Rosa; Molero Mesa, Joaquin"								High altitude flora of Sierra Nevada (Spain)								Flora Mediterranea				21				247	255					2011	2011	"Spanish Sierra Nevada has one of the richest and most original flora of the western Mediterranean region with a large number of endemic species.

We examined two sedimentary records showing several cycles with varying intensity of slope processes in the massif. Chronostratigraphic studies of solifluction landforms have revealed seven cycles of enhanced slope activity in Sierra Nevada during the last 7 ka. Lake sediments show eight periods with increased slope activity over the last 6 ka. Depending on temperature and moisture regime, erosion or conditions of slope stability prevailed. Cold and wet periods triggered slope processes and favoured deposition of coarse-grained sediments into the lakes, whereas warm phases were prone to soil development and fine-grained sedimentation in the lakes. The lake sediments also show evidence for an increasing aridity trend since the Holocene Optimum Warm Period in Sierra Nevada, which induced a shift of solifluction processes to higher elevations accompanying late-lying snow patches.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0305-8719		978-1-86239-327-1	WOS:000321868800015	J	Kottmann, Sina Lucia								MOCKING AND MIMING THE 'MOOR': STAGING OF THE 'SELF' AND 'OTHER' ON SPAIN'S BORDERS WITH MOROCCO								JOURNAL OF MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES				20	1			107	136					2011	2011	The age-old melange of Muslim and Christian cultures has left manifold visible and invisible traces on the landscapes and in the collective memory of modern-day Spain. Since the 1980s, immigration from the southern shores of the Mediterranean has increased significantly and Spain began to attract attention as an important site for junctions and fractures between Europe and the Maghreb. In the face of current political tensions, debates about the 'self' and the cultural, religious and ethnic 'other' on Europe's periphery have become remarkably delicate. Not only do resentments come to the fore, but there is appropriation of the Moorish legacy of Al-Andalus as well. This article presents two popular performances of historic Muslim-Christian 'clashes' in the Andalusian province of Granada: the Dia de la Toma in the city of Granada and a Festival of Moors and Christians in a small village south of the Sierra Nevada. The selected examples reveal the complexity of identity formation in southern Spain's multicultural reality, the ambivalence in the encounter with its past and present 'Moors' and the politicisation of the public sphere in the course of current regional and global upheavals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1016-3476			WOS:000209335300008	J	"Perez Latorre, A.

Alnus glutinosa forests in Sierra Nevada (Granada-Almeria, Spain)				SOBRE LAS ALISEDAS NEVADENSES (SIERRA NEVADA, GRANADA-ALMERIA, ESPANA)				Lagascalia				31				161	174					2011	2011	Alnus glutinosa forests in Sierra Nevada (Granada-Almeria, Spain). A phytosociological survey has been made on Alnus glutinosa forests in Sierra Nevada. Historical and bibliographical data have been compiled as well as published and new phytosociological inventories. The known distribution of Alnus glutinosa forests in Sierra Nevada is concentrated in two main zones: in the southern slope along the rivers Poqueira and Trevelez (Granada) and in the northern slope along the tributaries of the Alhama de Lugros river (Granada). They have been also inventoried in Almeria province (Andarax river). After detailed analysis of phytosociological inventories and tables as well as for the ecology, floristic composition, distribution and forest structure, we conclude that the A. glutinosa forests of Sierra Nevada represent a new association: Carici camposii-Alnetum glutinosae ass. nova. They are well developed forest with trees, shrubs, and grasses strata, appearing in river banks with permanent streams, on siliceous soils in the supramediterranean bioclimatic belt of the Nevadense phytogeographical sector (Betic province). A variant, indicated by Geum urbanum, develops in high incline slopes with permanent wet soils where A. glutinosa forests show the greatest biomass (canopy cover and height of trees). Analysis of synthetic table shows clear division from the rest of the Osmundo-Alnion south-Iberian forests, emphasizing the absence of the main indicator of the alliance (Osmunda regalis) in the new association.									0	0		1	0	1			0210-7708			BCI:BCI201300397693	J	"Gomez-Zurita, Jesus; Petitpierre, Eduard"								Contribution to the knowledge of the Iberian fauna of Chrysomelidae (Coleoptera).

Most of these records fill gaps in the known distribution of the species. The known range of Lachnaia pubescens is extended westwards (Caceres, Spain), that of Cryptocephalus blandulus southwestwards (Setubal, Portugal). We discuss the problems for the identification of Lachnaia pseudobarathraea, a species formerly thought to be endemic to the alpine belt of Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain), but actually present in most of south-eastern Spain. Clytra quadripunctata, Stylosomus ilicicola, Pachybrachis suffriani, Cryptocephalus cantabricus, C. luridicollis, and C. obliteratifer are new records for the Portuguese fauna of Chrysomelidae.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1134-6094			ZOOREC:ZOOR14707048991	J	"Gomez-Ortiz, Antonio; Oliva-Franganillo, Marc; Salva-Catarineu, Montserrat; Salvador-Franch, Ferran"								Landscape as a heritage resource in protected areas: the case of Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain)								SCRIPTA NOVA-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE GEOGRAFIA Y CIENCIAS SOCIALES				14	346									DEC 20 2010	2010	Sierra Nevada is a singular mountain range with an exceptional natural and cultural heritage.

Despite their enormous floristic and ecological originality, the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC does not mention them as priority habitats. This omission is striking given the particular attention paid by this Directive to other habitats which, like this one, are associated with special substrates. The shrublands of the Gypsophiletalia order, i.e. habitat 1520 of the above mentioned Directive corresponding to gypsophilous vegetation, are a particular case in the Iberian Peninsula. The extensive study of both habitats and their flora over recent years has provided a magnificent opportunity for us to compare them, review their current state of preservation and demand that more serious attention be paid to dolomites.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1253-8078			WOS:000285855600003	J	"Fernandez Calzado, Ma Rosa; Molero Mesa, Joaquin; Merzouki, Abderrahmane"								Monitoring plant diversity and climatic change in Sierra Nevada (Spain)								ACTA BOTANICA GALLICA				157	4			669	676					Dec-10	2010	"The aim of this paper is to analyse the vascular flora and temperature data in the highest zone of the Sierra Nevada massif (Sierra Nevada National Park) and evaluate the potential effects of climatic change on the biodiversity of this zone.

In this framework, it seems of special interest to compare our results with the existing information about the same territory which had been gathered by Boissier (172 years ago). It became apparent that the number has increased by 65 taxa, thus giving importance to the increased number of therophytes. Also, diverse taxa mentioned by Boissier as rare or scanty in lower altitude, are nowadays frequent in the highest part of Sierra Nevada.									0	0	0	2	0	2			1253-8078			WOS:000285855600007	J	"Padilla, Francisco M.; Vidal, Beatriz; Sanchez, Joaquin; Pugnaire, Francisco I."

Today, most these areas have become sensitive to human activity, prone to profound changes in land-use configuration and ecosystem services. A consensus exists amongst stakeholders that ecosystem services must be preserved but managerial strategies that help to preserve them while ensuring sustainability are often inadequate. To provide a basis for measuring implications of land-use change on carbon sequestration services, changes in land use and associated carbon sequestration potential throughout the 20th century in a rural area at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada range (SE Spain) were explored. We found that forest systems replaced dryland farming and pastures from the middle of the century onwards as a result of agricultural abandonment and afforestation programs. The area has always acted as a carbon sink with sequestration rates ranging from 28,961 t CO2 year(-1) in 1921 to 60,635 t CO2 year(-1) in 1995, mirroring changes in land use. Conversion from pastures to woodland, for example, accounted for an increase in carbon sequestration above 30,000 t CO2 year(-1) by the end of the century. However, intensive deforestation would imply a decrease of approximately 66% of the bulk CO2 fixed. In our study area, woodland conservation is essential to maintain the ecosystem services that underlie carbon sequestration. Our essay could inspire policymakers to better achieve goals of increasing carbon sequestration rates and sustainability within protected areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For this, the activity of the following antioxidant enzymes was determined: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione transferase (GST), and DT-diaphorase (DTD), together with lipid peroxidation. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was also determined. The four species studied were selected based on significant ecological and biological differences. The results obtained when studying different indicative parameters of the oxidative state of the nymph of different species showed that each has an important enzymatic antioxidant potential, and that differences among species are conditioned by the duration of the nymphal development period more than by whether they come from permanent or temporary habitats. Thus, Plecoptera, although traditionally considered as typical inhabitants of permanent waters, seem to have sufficient variability in physiological mechanisms, together with behavioral and ecological adaptations, to cope with potentially unfavorable conditions that may occur in temporary waters.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0289-0003			WOS:000284549600009	21110722J	"Jose Bullejos, Francisco; Carrillo, Presentacion; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"				Roles of phosphorus and ultraviolet radiation in the strength of phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling in a Mediterranean high mountain lake								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				55	6			2549	2562		10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2549			Nov-10	2010	"Ultraviolet solar radiation (UVR) and atmospheric nutrient inputs associated with aerosols are major worldwide stressors that simultaneously affect species and the interaction among them. A 2 x 5 field experimental design was used to determine how variations in light regimes (presence and absence of UVR [+UVR and -UVR]) and nutrients might influence the strength of phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling (PZC). We observed unimodal curves for zooplankton biomass in response to increased food supply from nutrient enrichment. These results challenge the ""more is better (or at least never worse)"" concept, since high food levels resulted in weakened PZC. The effect of UVR on zooplankton was nutrient dependent, significantly reducing zooplankton abundance at intermediate phosphorus (P) supplied levels but not at the two ends of the trophic gradient generated (control and highest P level). Neither food quantity nor food quality explained observed differences in zooplankton biomass between light treatments, suggesting a deleterious direct effect of UVR on zooplankton at intermediate food ranges, resulting in a weakening of PZC. The location of this lake in the Mediterranean region has shown an increasing intensity and frequency of aerosol depositions over the past three decades (1973-2003), resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. A combination of these higher atmospheric dust depositions with the high UVR levels characteristic of high mountain lakes might underlie the interannual decoupling between phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics observed in these oligotrophic ecosystems."									8	0	0	8	0	8			0024-3590			WOS:000287844700026	J	"Galiano, L.; Martinez-Vilalta, J.; Lloret, F."

Under climate change, those effects could signal potential vegetation shifts occurring over large geographical areas, with major impacts on ecosystem form and function. In this article, we studied the effect of a single drought episode, occurred which in summer 2005, on a Scots pine population in central Pyrenees (NE Spain). Our main objective was to study the environmental correlates of forest decline and vegetation change at the plot level. General and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation, mortality and recruitment, and plot characteristics. A drought-driven multifactor dieback was observed in the study forest. Defoliation and mortality were associated with the local level of drought stress estimated at each plot. In addition, stand structure, soil properties, and mistletoe infection were also associated with the observed pattern of defoliation, presumably acting as long-term predisposing factors. Recruitment of Scots pine was low in all plots. In contrast, we observed abundant recruitment of other tree species, mostly Quercus ilex and Q. humilis, particularly in plots where Scots pine showed high defoliation and mortality. These results suggest that an altitudinal upwards migration of Quercus species, mediated by the dieback of the currently dominant species, may take place in the studied slopes. Many rear-edge populations of Scots pine sheltered in the mountain environments of the Iberian Peninsula could be at risk under future climate scenarios.									83	1	0	71	0	84			1432-9840			WOS:000282699200003	J	"Pepin, E.; Carretier, S.; Herail, G."

Moreover, other studies have shown that the evolution of a fan could strongly depend on feedback between the fan and the mountain catchment. We evaluate if natural entrenchment still occurs in a coupled catchment-fan system, and we evaluate its possible impact on the evolution of mountain erosion. We use a landscape evolution model where the mountain corresponds to an uplifting block and where fans form over an initial horizontal surface. Our experiments confirm that deep entrenchment at the fan apex can occur without a change in climate or in uplift rate under two conditions: (1) the transport threshold (critical shear stress) is significant and (2) the downstream boundary condition corresponds to an open boundary with fixed elevation, which stops the progradation of alluvial fans. A stable entrenchment occurs when sediments reach this limit. The entrenchment can be explained by a strong nonlinear dependence of the transport law on the slope when the shear stress is close to critical. A fan slope increase occurs when sediments reach the model limit, and this drives entrenchment. Fan entrenchment drives strong erosion in the mountain with intensity and a response time similar to those observed for the initial mountain uplift. These results indicate that determining how much of natural erosion is from autogenic mechanisms is essential in order to link landscape entrenchment with past external changes.

New radiometric data from U-Pb zircon dating on gneisses from the western Sierra Nevada confirm the presence of late Carboniferous intrusive rocks in the Betic hinterland. These results, combined with available data from the literature and a detailed structural analysis, suggest that the gneisses represent a single late Variscan magmatic event. Evidence for a close genetic relation between gneisses and tourmalinites is provided by field and petrographic observations, in conjunction with geochemical data, U-Pb zircon (314 +/- 7: 304 +/- 23 Ma) and Ar-40/Ar-39 tourmaline (319.85 +/- 5.81; 317.85 +/- 3.67 Ma) geochronology. A pre-late Carboniferous age for the basal formation of the Nevado-Filabride sequence can be inferred. The gneiss protolith and the graphite schist are considered to be the boron source and the precursor of the tourmalinites, respectively. Superposed tectonic units rather than a continuous Palaeozoic sequence is supported by the occurrence of Palaeozoic rocks at the top of the Nevado-Filabride complex. The nappe tectonics, as evidenced from the contractional character of the unit boundaries and the superposition of higher-grade on lower-grade metamorphic rocks, is additionally supported by the superposition of older on younger rocks as revealed from radiometric data.

They also provide some of the most diverse and species-rich habitats in the world. What is largely unknown, however, is how sediment deposition affects plant community composition in these forests. The objective of this study was to examine changes in plant community composition across a gradient of increasing rates of sedimentation in riparian forests in the southeastern Coastal Plain, USA. Seventeen plots were established within riparian forests receiving between 0 and 5.5 cm year(-1) of sediment deposits. Species density and biomass estimates were collected annually from 2002 to 2006 for overstory and mid-story plant species within each plot. Percent cover and nested frequency of understory plant species were determined annually during 2004-2006. Measures of community composition in the understory, mid-story, and overstory layers of forests were compared to changes in environmental factors associated with increased sedimentation. In the understory, annual, exotic, and upland species had higher importance values in plots receiving high sediment deposition. The densities of shade-intolerant and N-fixing species in the mid-story also increased with increasing sedimentation rates. Increased overstory mortality was associated with high sedimentation rates, though increases in understory light levels in these gaps were not the main driver of understory species changes. Edaphic factors, such as soil texture, moisture, and temperature, were significantly correlated to species composition in all three forest layers, suggesting that changes in soil physical structure due to sedimentation may drive community-level changes in these forests.									10	0	0	10	1	10			1385-0237			WOS:000281259700002	J	"Gonzalez-Gonzalez, E.

Decrease in phosphate sorption properties was observed in transects from the littoral zone to dry land (up to the high water mark) in both lakes concomitantly with loss of amorphous oxides of iron and aluminum as revealed by oxalate and dithionite extractions. X-ray diffraction did not indicate increased amounts of crystalline metal oxides, but there was a loss of fine particles (< 20 mu m) with distance from the shore, probably due to wind erosion. Likely this explains the loss of amorphous metal oxides as they are often enriched in the fine sediment fraction. Changes in P-speciation toward less available pools were also observed as a result of desiccation. When re-wetted under oxic conditions, the sediments, especially those closest to the shore, released phosphate to the overlying water. The loss of adsorption capacity for phosphate upon re-wetting was associated with loss of amorphous iron oxides, and the changes appear to be non-reversible. Thus, both desiccation and re-wetting will lead to a decrease in sediment phosphate sorption capacity and increased water level fluctuations, a possible scenario in climate change, can therefore increase P availability in the water column of these oligotrophic systems.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0018-8158			WOS:000278923600019	J	"Gomez, Jose M.; Abdelaziz, Mohamed; Lorite, Juan; Jesus Munoz-Pajares, A.; Perfectti, Francisco"				"Perfectti, Francisco/C-5087-2008; Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Munoz-Pajares, A.

Pollen limitation may be a consequence of changes in pollinator abundance, diversity and identity. However, no empirical evidence exists concerning the consequences that the spatial variation in pollinator fauna has on pollen limitation intensity and plant reproduction. In this study, we test the effect that changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity exert on the occurrence and strength of pollen limitation by experimentally quantifying pollen limitation in eight populations of Erysimum mediohispanicum, a pollination-generalist plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.2. Pollen limitation was accounted for by using a comprehensive estimator, the net reproductive rate (R(0)). Nevertheless, we also determined which components of plant reproduction, from ovule fertilization to seedling survival, were more intensely pollen-limited. Finally, we explored whether the spatial variation in pollen limitation intensity was related to among-population changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity.3. The whole reproductive cycle of E. mediohispanicum was pollen-limited, although pollen limitation occurred more strongly during the ovule fertilization and seed-production phases than during fruit ripening or seedling emergence and establishment.4. There was a significant among-population difference in pollen limitation intensity. Pollen limitation strength was associated with variations in flower-visitor diversity, and identity. Populations with lower flower-visitor diversity and with many low-efficiency pollinators (i.e. beetles) showed stronger pollen limitation.5. Synthesis. Our study shows that the intensity of pollen limitation at the population level may depend on several characteristics of the assemblage of flower-visiting insects, such as their abundance, diversity and identity. Our results suggest that any impoverishment of pollinator diversity or any alteration in the specific composition of the pollinator assemblage may exacerbate pollen limitation.									52	1	0	47	1	52			0022-0477			WOS:000280667200028	J	"Matias, Luis; Zamora, Regino; Mendoza, Irene; Hodar, Jose A."

The main objective was to determine whether seed dispersal by mammals was related to habitat degradation within a mosaic of adjacent degraded patches mixed with native forest and thereby to determine the potential role of mammals as seed dispersers in degraded landscape units. For three consecutive years, mammal feces were collected in the fruit production period, extracting all seeds of woody species found therein and analyzing their viability. Feces were collected in three different plots for each of five different landscape units: shrubland, native forest, and dense, cleared, and fenced reforestation stands. Seeds from 16 woody species (which represent more than a half of the total fleshy-fruited woody species available) were recorded, although some agrarian species are also introduced in a low percentage of the scats. Seeds showed a high viability rate for all dispersed species, irrespective of the mammal disperser. No differences in species composition appeared in the overall landscape units or in the seed density between degraded habitats. Due to the small patch size, the high viability of dispersed seeds, and the large home range of the large mammals, these three animal species act as efficient seed dispersers for a diverse assemblage of woody plant species regardless of the habitat type within this degradation framework. This fact has important consequences for the biodiversity recuperation in these degraded habitats, principally in pine plantations.									18	0	0	17	1	19			1061-2971			WOS:000281552500001	J	"Catry, F.

However, managers from this region are confronted with a lack of information on the effects of fire on most woody species, which is required for defining sustainable forest management strategies. Following a large wildfire in central Portugal (2003), we surveyed the area during the first year and assessed the vegetative condition of 1040 burned trees from 11 different species. Among those trees, 755 individuals were selected and monitored annually for 4 years. At the end of the study, almost all the broadleaved trees survived, while most coniferous died. In spite of the low mortality observed in broadleaves, most were top-killed and regenerated only from basal resprouts, which implies a slow recovering process. Quercus suber, however, showed vigorous post-fire crown resprouting and was the most resilient species. We fitted logistic regression models to predict the probability of individual tree mortality and top-kill from fire injury indicators and tree characteristics. Besides the differences between the two main functional groups (coniferous, broadleaved), bole char height and crown volume scorched or consumed were important predictors of tree responses. Additionally, the main factor determining crown mortality on broadleaved species was bark thickness. The selected models performed well when tested with independent data obtained on four other wildfires. These models have several potential applications and can be useful to managers making pre-fire or post-fire decisions in mixed forest stands in the western Mediterranean Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ski runs were selected in Sierra Nevada ski station (SE Spain) in which hydroseeding was performed from 2002 to 2005. The sampling design was based on a chronosequence approach, using natural areas established as 'models' (i.e. target for long-term restoration) to evaluate the restoration success based on the similarity to the model. Although parameters such as growth, cover, and even richness or diversity reached similar values to the ones in the model areas after 4 years (i.e. natural perennial mountain pastures), other indicators such as composition, measured in a qualitative way as the ratio of colonizing species to total species, showed different occurrence values for the most abundant species. Moreover, when the whole pool of species was taken into account using discriminant analysis, the results differed, showing that although the process performed well, the recovery (sensu stricto) requires longer periods than the duration assessed to be fully successful. The results showed that common parameters, such as growth, cover, richness, or diversity, when used solely may lead to misinterpretation, and therefore additional methods to compare composition, such as the discriminant analysis, are strongly recommended.

We conducted an extensive microsatellite analysis to examine the population genetics of the southern long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum sigillatum) in a naturally complex landscape. Using spatially explicit modelling, we investigated the influence of the Sierra Nevada topography on potential dispersal corridors between sampled populations. Our results indicate very high-genetic divergence among populations, high within-deme relatedness, and little evidence of recent migration or population admixture. We also discovered unexpectedly high between-year genetic differentiation (F(ST)) for breeding sites, suggesting that breeding groups vary over localized space and time. While environmental factors associated with high-elevation montane habitats apparently play an important role in shaping population differentiation, additional, species-specific biological processes must also be operating to account for observed deviations from temporal, among-year panmixia. Our study emphasizes the population-level insights that can be gained from high-density sampling in space and time, and the highly substructured population biology that may characterize amphibians in extreme montane habitats.									26	0	0	26	0	26			0962-1083			WOS:000280664900005	20701683J	"Fernandes, Paulo M.; Luz, Ana; Loureiro, Carlos"				Fernandes, Paulo/A-6948-2008	Fernandes, Paulo/0000-0003-0336-4398			Changes in wildfire severity from maritime pine woodland to contiguous forest types in the mountains of northwestern Portugal								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				260	5			883	892		10.1016/j.foreco.2010.06.008			JUL 30 2010	2010	Large and severe wildfires are now widespread in the Mediterranean Basin. Fire severity is important to ecosystem properties and processes and to forest management but it has been neglected by wildland fire research in Europe. In this study, we compare fire severity between maritime pine (PS) woodland and other forest (OF) types, identify other variables influent on fire severity, and describe its variation. We sampled contiguous, paired stands of PS and OF cover types - including deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and short-needled mountain conifers - that burned under very high to extreme fire danger in northwestern Portugal. Data on stand characteristics and fire severity metrics were collected in plots along transects perpendicular to the PS-OF boundary. Fire severity was rated in separate for the tree canopy, understorey vegetation and forest floor layers, and then an average (composite) fire severity rating was calculated. Fire intensity inferred from stem char height (adjusted for the effects of other factors) was highest in PS, followed by deciduous broadleaved woodland and short-needled conifer forest. With a few exceptions, all fire severity ratings were significantly different between PS and OF at all sites. Most fire severity metrics and ratings were correlated. The distance for fire severity minimization did not differ between OF types (median = 21 m). Variation in composite fire severity was accounted for by a classification tree (R(2) = 0.44) based on cover type (contributing with 51% to the overall explanation), stand variables, aspect, distance to the PS-OF edge and fire spread pattern. Except for a more immediate decline in deciduous broadleaves, fire severity rating was not affected by OF type and tended to decrease in more mature stands and moister aspects. The fire severity moderation from PS to OF was compounded by a dominant pattern of down slope fire propagation into moister topographical positions, exacerbating the fuel effect implicit in the cover type change. The results are consistent with fire hazard and fire incidence studies and support conventional knowledge that advocates the expansion of broadleaved deciduous or evergreen forest as a means to achieve more fire-resilient ecosystems and landscapes.

The southern and western mountain fronts of the Sierra Nevada are fault-bounded, while the northern one is an unconformity between the Neogene-Quaternary sediments of the Guadix-Baza basin and the metamorphic rocks of the Nevado-Filabride complex. We have carried out a geomorphic study by examining drainage patterns and characteristics of mountain fronts in order to reveal areal variations and styles of rock uplift. Mountain front sinuosity (S(mf)), area-altitude relations (hypsometric curves), and valley floor entrenchment differ significantly between the northern, western, and southern mountain fronts. The lack of important faults along the northern Sierra Nevada mountain front, together with the elevated topographic position of the Guadix-Baza basin (average altitude is around 1100 m), points to similar uplift of both geomorphic units (sierra and basin) in a single large-scale crustal block. The asymmetry factors show systematic asymmetries at both sides of the Lanjaron River, probably due to the presence of an active NNE-SSW oriented antiform in the western Sierra Nevada. Finally, river profiles indicate maximal river entrenchment in the western part of the Sierra Nevada, probably related to the uplift of the footwall of the Padul-Niguelas fault-system. Therefore, our geomorphic analysis suggests that the western part of the Sierra Nevada is tectonically active by means of a combination of normal faults along the mountain front and NNE-SSW oriented active folds, which, in turn, likely have a gravitational origin related to the exhumation of the footwall of the normal fault-system.

We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of open-and early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid-and late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments. Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects.									33	0	0	31	0	33			0888-8892			WOS:000277690900024	20015262J	"Zamora, Regino; Antonio Hodar, Jose; Matias, Luis; Mendoza, Irene"				"Matias, Luis/B-4340-2011; Mendoza, Irene/A-3729-2012; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/G-1134-2014; Matias, Luis/K-6761-2014; Matias, Luis/H-6184-2015"	"Mendoza, Irene/0000-0002-8692-0507; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/0000-0002-3288-6366; Matias, Luis/0000-0002-6245-1857; Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390"			Positive adjacency effects mediated by seed disperser birds in pine plantations								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				20	4			1053	1060		10.1890/09-0055.1			Jun-10	2010	This study examines the consequences of adjacent elements for a given patch, through their effects on zoochorous dispersion by frugivorous birds. The case study consists of pine plantations (the focal patch) adjacent to other patches of native vegetation ( mixed patches of native forest and shrublands), and/or pine plantations. Our hypothesis is that input of native woody species propagules generated by frugivorous birds within plantations strongly depends on the nature of the surrounding vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we studied frugivorous-bird abundance, seed dispersion, and seedling establishment in nine pine plantation plots in contact with patches of native vegetation. To quantify adjacency arrangement effects, we used the percentage of common border between a patch and each of its adjacent elements. Frugivorous bird occurrence in pine plantations is influenced by the adjacent vegetation: the greater the contact with native vegetation patches, the more abundant were the frugivorous birds within pine plantations. Furthermore, frugivorous birds introduce into plantations the seeds of a large sample of native fleshy-fruited species. The results confirm the hypothesis that zoochorous seed rain is strongly determined by the kind of vegetation surrounding a given plantation. This finding underlines the importance of the composition of the mosaic surrounding plantations and the availability of mobile link species as key landscape features conditioning passive restoration processes.									26	0	0	24	1	27			1051-0761			WOS:000278865200012	20597289J	"Sarasa, M.; Serrano, E.; Perez, J.

We explored the effects of age, body condition and season on relative testes mass in the Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica. We analysed the variability of testes mass from 175 individuals, using a model selection approach based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for a small sample size. The results suggest that season, age and body condition influenced relative testes mass. Allocation to testes mass was greatest in the rutting season (autumn) and at ages that are associated with a subordinate status and a coursing, rather than mate-guarding, reproductive strategy. In addition, males in good condition had relatively heavier testes than those in poor condition. Thus, testes mass in Iberian ibex is governed by multiple factors, and this study leads to a better understanding of gonad plasticity in this polygamous ungulate. The effect of age matches the predictions from theoretical studies on sperm competition, which suggests greater allocation to testes in disadvantaged males.									8	0	0	6	0	8			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000277920100008	J	Mueller, B.

We analyzed the direct effect of UVR on enzymatic antioxidant responses (catalase [CAT], glutathione S-transferase [GST], and glutathione reductase [GR]) of two calanoid copepod species-Boeckella gibbosa and Mixodiaptomus laciniatus-and the indirect effects of food quality (carbon : nutrient ratio) potentially affecting body elemental compositions and hence enzymatic activities. Responses for the three enzymes were different: GST increased its activity under UVR exposure in the two copepods, CAT activity was null and showed no response, and GR activity differed between species. Light treatments also affected sestonic elemental ratios; UVR exposure lowered carbon : phosphorus (C : P) ratios, which in turn affected the C: P elemental compositions of the copepods. However, nutrient addition had different effects on the two species; it did not affect final somatic C: P ratio of B. gibbosa but had a substantial effect on body elemental composition of M. laciniatus. Finally, the relationship between grazer's C: P ratio and GST antioxidant enzyme activity was negative. UVR and nutrient inputs affected food quality, grazer somatic stoichiometry, and subsequently enzymatic responses. The ability of calanoid copepods to overcome increased UVR may depend, at least for GST, on the elemental nutrient balance of the food."									11	0	0	11	0	11			0024-3590			WOS:000277650900006	J	"Palenzuela, Javier; Miguel Barea, Jose; Ferrol, Nuria; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion; Oehl, Fritz"				"Ferrol, Nuria/H-5330-2015; Azcon, Concepcion/H-5873-2015; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015"	"Ferrol, Nuria/0000-0001-7963-3537; Azcon, Concepcion/0000-0003-3041-8566; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718"			Entrophospora nevadensis, a new arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus from Sierra Nevada National Park (southeastern Spain)								MYCOLOGIA				102	3			624	632		10.3852/09-145			MAY-JUN 2010	2010	A new fungal species in the arbuscular mycorrhiza-forming Glomeromycetes, Entrophospora nevadensis, was isolated from soil near the roots of several endemic and endangered plant species (e.g. Plantago nivalis and Alchemilla fontqueri) growing in Sierra Nevada National Park (Granada, Andalucia, Spain). The fungus was propagated in trap cultures on Plantago nivalis and Sorbus hybrida and in pure cultures on Trifolium pratense and Sorghum vulgare. Spores are yellow brown to brown, 90-115 mu m diam and form singly in soil, in the neck of adherent sporiferous saccules that form either terminally or intercalary on mycelial hyphae. Spores have two three-layered walls and conspicuous, 6-12 mu m long, spiny, thorn-like projections on the outer wall consisting of hyaline to subhyaline, evanescent tips and yellow brown to brown, persistent bases. In aging spores these projections are usually shorter (1-2.8 mu m) and dome-shaped or rounded, sometimes with a central pit on top where the evanescent tip has sloughed off. Molecular analysis with partial sequences of the 18S ribosomal gene places the fungus within the Diversisporales. The new fungus was found in soil near plants with different living strategies but growing in high altitude soils with acidic pH, high soil moisture and organic carbon content, and close to streams.									24	0	0	22	0	24			0027-5514			WOS:000278356900013	20524595J	"de Vicente, Inmaculada; Guerrero, Francisco; Jimenez-Gomez, Francisco; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis"				"Guerrero, Francisco/E-7704-2012; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/E-7093-2012"	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; JIMENEZ GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0001-8644-7089"			Settling and resuspended particles: A source or a sink of phosphate in two contrasting oligotrophic high mountain lakes?								COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE				342	1			46	52		10.1016/j.crte.2009.10.004			Jan-10	2010	"This study focuses on two Mediterranean oligotrophic high mountain lakes located in the Sierra Nevada National Park (southern Spain): Rio Seco (RS) and La Caldera (LC). A combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments is used: (i) to quantify in situ settling fluxes; (ii) to study the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) release or uptake by settling and resuspended particles; and (iii) to discriminate between the biotic and abiotic contribution for such patterns. In general, all suspensions (lake water untreated and lake water enriched with settling and with resuspended matter) in both study lakes release significantly more SRP to the solution when biological activity was suppressed. Biological uptake from settling and resuspended matter is likely to be limited by the bacteria] consumption of P. Despite of these similarities, this study has revealed notable differences in the effect of sediment resuspension on SRP dynamics in both study lakes, when simulating natural conditions (biotic and abiotic processes). While in LC, the enrichment of lake water with settling and with resuspended matter did not cause an increase in SRP concentrations in lake water, SRP concentrations in RS at the end of the experiment were significantly higher (probability P < 0.05) in lake water enriched with resuspended matter (3.2 mu g/l) than in natural lake water (lower than the detection limit). Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect that sediment resuspension, which occurs more frequently in RS compared with LC, affects drastically the SRP availability in the water column in RS.

This work presents the first user version which includes all processes that determine water flows along the watershed, carefully considering characteristic aspects of Mediterranean watersheds with influence on the spatial and temporal variability, as well as processes where topography may substantially affect the results. WiMMed focuses on the distributed modelling at the cell scale of the digital elevation model and the resolution at different temporal scales in the same calculation sequence in order to better reproduce physical simulated processes. To this purpose, the model was developed and validated in the Guadalfeo river watershed (Granada, Southern Spain), where the topographic gradient between the high mountains of Sierra Nevada and the coast in less than 70 km distance has led to a wide heterogeneity of climate, soil, meteorological conditions (snow occurrence every year), vegetation, water sources, soil uses, and water demand. The topographic algorithms pose a great potential for the study of ungauged watersheds by means of computer techniques from a digital elevation model, and constitute a useful tool for water planning and management that can be technically applied in any other watershed.

Differences in the diversity and composition of the pollinator assemblage of two co-flowering congeneric alpine wallflowers, Erysimum nevadense and E. baeticum								FLORA				205	4			266	275		10.1016/j.flora.2009.04.005			2010	2010	Many alpine plants display a generalist pollination system where almost any available flower visitor could act as a legitimate pollinator. Co-flowering related plant species displaying a generalized pollination system can decrease their fitness due to interspecific mating. In this study, we determine the difference in diversity and composition of the pollination systems of two co-occurring species endemic to the alpine region of the Sierra Nevada (SE Spain), Erysimum nevadense Reut. and Erysimum baeticum baeticum (Heywood) Polatschek (Brassicaceae), and check for the potential role of floral and plant traits in explaining the observed differences. For this, we labeled 30 plants in two populations of each plant species located in the same area. We determined flower visitor assemblage by sampling all insects approaching the flowers and contacting the sexual organs during 60-min surveys. We found that the diversity of the pollinator assemblage was similar between the two studied wallflower species, both species showing a much generalized pollination system. However, the composition of the pollinator assemblage was different, since the flowers of E. nevadense were visited mostly by beetles and in a lesser extent by hover-flies, whereas the flowers of E. baeticum baeticum were visited mostly by ants and bees. Interestingly, flower traits varied between species, with E. nevadense displaying yellow, smaller and shallower flowers and E. baeticum baeticum displaying purple, large and deeper flowers. These findings suggest that differences in floral traits can explain the observed differences in the composition of the pollinator assemblage between both wallflower species. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Evolucion demografica de la cabra montes en Andalucia en los ultimos 100 anos.				Galemys				22				347	358				(Numero Especial)	2010	2010	The bibliographical data (Schimper 1848, Cabrera 1911, 1914, Chapman and Buck 1905, and even the more recent data from Rodriguez de la Zubia 1967) available on Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) unveils a woeful situation in terms of number of individuals and population nucleus. However, a note of hope is sounded in terms of evolution and dispersion of populations over the last 10 years, when a different approach and data on the number of Spanish ibex hunted in Andalusia over the last 50 years are taken into account. The analysis properly distinguishes between certain milestones, including the designation of hunting reserves, the mange outbreak and the designation of Sierra Nevada National Park, which have led to strategic changes in Spanish ibex management measures and have had an impact on the current status of the populations. Prior to the creation of national reserves or hunting preserves, there are few references on the number of Spanish ibex captured for hunting or recreational purposes. The first records available date back to 1954 in Sierra de Cazorla. In the period from 1967 to 1987 (mange outbreak at Cazorla), the only records available reveal that 99 Spanish ibex trophies were validated in the four protected areas, each covering an average area of 2,072 km2. In the period from 1988 to 1999 (designation of Sierra Nevada National Park), the Spanish ibex has started to expand its home range into the hunting preserves around the Reserve. Ninety-seven (97) trophies from 10 hunting preserves covering approximately 2,800 km2 were validated. The expansion trend has significantly picked up pace in the period from 2000 to 2008, with 151 trophies in 8 years in an area covering 2,800 km2 (excluding the National Park). The validated ibex trophies come from 41 hunting preserves, most of which are located in the vicinity of Sierra Nevada. The expansion of wild goats has fostered by changes in land use, abandonment of forests and forest management. The protection afforded by National Park purposes may explain the spectacular expansion of goats towards the immediate surroundings, including Gador, Lujar and Huetor. Thus, the density of the core nucleus has not been overreached and the possibility of hunting this species has increased, in particular for local hunting associations and preserves.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1137-8700			ZOOREC:ZOOR14709066895	J	"Cano-Manuel, Francisco Javier; Granados, Jose Enrique; Aspizua, Rut; Barea, Miguel; Sanchez, Francisco Javier; Henares, Ignacio Luis; Navarro, Francisco Javier"								Global change and Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in Sierra Nevada, Spain.

Twenty-jive years ago, the then National Hydraulic Works Authority (now the National Water Authority), taking into account the importance of snowfalls in the management of water resources, initiated the ERHIN programme (Study on Water Resources originating from Innivation). The object of this was to quantify the processes in question and thus enable the management of those reservoirs situated at the foot of the principal Spanish mountain ranges. During recent years, the various systems for monitoring snow cover in mountain areas (measurements based on satellite imaging) have advanced and improved. An IT system (ASTER) enables the volume of water accumulated in the form of snow to be simulated (time-space distribution), thereby facilitating forecasts of snow melt flows. The ASTER model is currently used in conjunction with SAIH (Automatic Hydrological Information System) to forecast inflows for the main reservoirs in Spain. The main characteristics of the EHRIN programme and the ASTER model, along with the results obtained to date for the Ebro basin, are analysed in this article.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-6368			WOS:000280468100008	J	"Martin, Rocio; Prieto, Carlos E."

A poorly studied factor likely affecting recruitment is the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds. Seed-caching animals are thought to disperse seeds in a way that reduces clumping and density to impede cache pilfering. Furthermore, dispersal might differ depending on whether the seed is immediately consumed versus cached for later consumption, and might differ depending on the ecological context. The main objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the spatial pattern of seed dispersal by rodents in a heterogeneous environment; 2) whether the patterns differ among years and among acorn competitor exclosure treatments, and 3) whether rodents create different spatial patterns of dispersal for acorns that are cached versus consumed immediately following dispersal. We studied the degree of spatial aggregation of acorn dispersal by rodents using two different estimators derived from the Ripley K and the Diggle G functions. We also analyzed various metrics of dispersal distances. For both analyses we used observed acorn dispersal patterns in two years differing in crop size and inside versus outside exclosures restricting access to acorn-consuming ungulates. During 2003, a year with a larger crop size, maximum seed dispersal distances were less, and the pattern of dispersed seeds was more clumped, than in 2004, a year with a smaller crop size. Median dispersal distances did not differ between years. In the presence of ungulates, seed dispersal was marginally sparser than in their absence. Cached acorns were dispersed more sparsely than acorns eaten immediately. These results have important implications for the quality of seed dispersal for oak recruitment that are likely relevant to other systems as well."									11	0	0	12	0	12			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000273069000020	S	"De Matias, J.; Guerrero, J.

An assessment along abiotic and biotic gradients								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				19	8			2124	2141		10.1890/08-1656.1			Dec-09	2009	"The ecological impacts of forest plantations are a focus of intense debate, from studies that consider plantations as ""biological deserts"" to studies showing positive effects on plant diversity and dynamics. This lack of consensus might be influenced by the scarcity of studies that examine how the ecological characteristics of plantations vary along abiotic and biotic gradients. Here we conducted a large-scale assessment of plant regeneration and diversity in plantations of southern Spain. Tree seedling and sapling density, plant species richness, and Shannon's (H') diversity index were analyzed in 442 pine plantation plots covering a wide gradient of climatic conditions, stand density, and distance to natural forests that act as seed sources.Pronounced variation in regeneration and diversity was found in plantation understories along the gradients explored. Low-to mid-altitude plantations showed a diverse and abundant seedling bank dominated by Quercus ilex, whereas high-altitude plantations showed a virtually monospecific seeding bank of Pinus sylvestris. Regeneration was null in plantations with stand densities exceeding 1500 pines/ha. Moderate plantation densities (500-1000 pines/ha) promoted recruitment in comparison to low or null canopy cover, suggesting the existence of facilitative interactions. Quercus ilex recruitment diminished exponentially with distance to the nearest Q. ilex forest. Richness and H' index values showed a hump-shaped distribution along the altitudinal and radiation gradients and decreased monotonically along the stand density gradient.From a management perspective, different strategies will be necessary depending on where a plantation lies along the gradients explored. Active management will be required in high-density plantations with arrested succession and low diversity. Thinning could redirect plantations toward more natural densities where facilitation predominates. Passive management might be recommended for low-to moderate-density plantations with active successional dynamics (e. g., toward oak or pine-oak forests at low to mid altitudes). Enrichment planting will be required to overcome seed limitation, especially in plantations far from natural forests. We conclude that plantations should be perceived as dynamic systems where successional trajectories and diversity levels are determined by abiotic constraints, complex balances of competitive and facilitative interactions, the spatial configuration of native seed sources, and species life-history traits."									51	1	0	43	0	52			1051-0761			WOS:000271874300013	20014583J	"Manuel Tierno De Figueroa, J.; Luzon-Ortega, Julio M.; Lopez-Rodriguez, Manuel J."

The Beninar Reservoir (60 hm(3)), which entered into service in 1983, has suffered from severe leakage from the outset, preventing it from performing the water management functions originally foreseen for it; however, it has also made it possible to determine the response of the underlying carbonate aquifer into which the reservoir water is draining. This response has been studied based on historical data as well as the occurrence of an extraordinary recharge produced by a period of exceptionally heavy rainfall. A conceptual model of the system's functioning has been established by analyzing leakage rates, piezometric variations, the discharge through the only spring in the area (the Fuentes de Marbella spring) and the physical-chemical characteristics of the aquifer water. Geological and structural aspects of the carbonate formation were also included. An alternative solution for water regulation in the river basin is proposed: the construction of a smaller dam downstream from the spring. This dam would induce recharge through the permeable base of the reservoir, raise the piezometric level and thus increase its storage capacity, as well as control and regulate the water discharged from the spring."									6	0	0	4	0	6			1431-2174			WOS:000270980700017	J	"Mladenov, N.; Lopez-Ramos, J.; McKnight, D.

Molar absorption coefficients at 250 and 280 nm in the lake were highly correlated with those in organic aerosol deposition, originating mainly from Saharan dust, and suggest that absorption in clear alpine lakes in unvegetated catchments may represent a unique sentinel of desertification and global change. Using parallel factor analysis modeling to resolve dominant fluorescent components, we identified a semiquinone-like fluorophore (C9) in the WSOC of deposition that was traced into the lake. At least three fluorescent components, including C9, contributed significantly to absorption of WSOC from atmospheric deposition. Saharan dust supplied chromophoric, aromatic, and fluorescent organic matter to this alpine lake.

Thermochronology of granodioritic samples collected from a vertical [age-elevation] profile from the south-central Maladeta pluton provide new constraints on the timing of thrust faulting and rock exhumation of the Pyrenean orogen. The Maladeta massif lies within the Orri thrust sheet, presently occupying the immediate footwall of the Gavarnie thrust, a major Axial Zone Alpine-age thrust fault. New biotite and K-feldspar (40)Ar/(39)Ar and apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) data combined with previous apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology and structural studies of the Maladeta pluton constrain the thermal evolution of this massif. Biotite weighted mean plateau and K-feldspar maxi MUM (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages from the highest elevations of the Maladeta pluton (2850 m) are similar to 280 Ma, close to the age of intrusion, and are interpreted to date the timing of rapid cooling in the Hercynian. Subsequently the Maladeta Massif remained close to the surface as indicated by the presence of unconformable Triassic continental sediments. K-feldspar (40)Ar/(39)Ar multiple diffusion domain thermal models from two samples at lower elevations (1780 m and 1400 m) indicate heating initiated at similar to 65 Ma, reaching maximum temperatures of 270 to 280 degrees C. These data are interpreted to record thrust burial of the Maladeta pluton to depths of similar to 6-10 km in the footwall of the Gavarnie thrust. Burial and heating were followed by a period of relatively rapid cooling beginning at similar to 50 Ma, recorded in three K-feldspar thermal models from samples at different elevations (2850 m, 1780 m, and 1400 m). AFT thermal models, in conjunction with the AFT and apatite AHe age-elevation profile interpretation reveal a lower temperature portion of the thermal history. These data indicate the onset of rapid cooling that began at 30-35 Ma, slowed dramatically at 25-30 Ma. and continued at a reduced rate until similar to 15 Ma. Finally, AFT thermal models from the lowest elevation samples record rapid cooling in the Late Miocene-Pliocene, most likely due to re-excavation of the southern flank of the Pyrenean orogen, following burial by syn-tectonic conglomerates. The integrated thermochronologic data set from the age-elevation profile within the Maladeta pluton illustrates the potential for obtaining age constraints related to processes operating within the interior portions of convergent orogenic systems (e.g., the onset and/or duration of thrust fault activity) that are otherwise unobtainable.

Post mortem examination revealed an overall prevalence of 72% for adult nematodes (Cystocaulus ocreatus 44%, Muellerius capillaris 44%, Protostronsylus sp. 40%, and Dictyocaulus filaria 4%). The abundances were 13.45 +/- 3.97, 5.18 +/- 2.49, 6.36 +/- 2.16, and 2.27 +/- 0.46, respectively. Protostrongylid adults showed similar infection rates, which were statistically different from that of D. filaria. 20% of the examined Iberian ibexes were infected by three protostrongylid nematodes species, 24% of C. pyrenaica were affected by two protostrongylid species, while infestations with only one protostrongylid species were detected in 20% of the examined animals. The overall prevalence of larvae nematodes in the examined animals was 100%, and the overall abundance (number of the first stage larvae per gram) was 86.45 +/- 20.63. There was a high correlation between the two sets of data (adults and larvae). Results of the present investigation provided foundation for the effective control of bronchopulmonary nematode infection in Iberian ibex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Lobes are almost inactive under the current semiarid climate and water availability appears to be the crucial control on activity within the high-elevation Study areas. The presence of numerous inactive solifluction lobes suggests that past climate conditions must have been more favourable for lobe development. Chronostratigraphic profiles of several lobes indicate that colder and/or wetter periods (e.g. the Little Ice Age) tend to promote slope movements, with sparser vegetation cover and higher solifluction rates whereas a denser vegetation cover spreads across valley floors and soils develop during warmer periods (e.g. the Medieval Warm Period).

ID-TIMS U-Pb ages for zircon and monazite from these granitic rocks indicate emplacements within a short period of time at 479-480 Ma. Granodiorite G1 is the most deformed rock with shear zones and deformation at the border. G1 and G3 contain fine-grained biotite tonalite and biotite granodiorite microgranular enclaves, which are darker and richer in mafic minerals than the host granodiorites. The geological, mineralogical, geochemical and Sr, Nd and O isotopic data show that tonalitic and granodioritic enclaves and host G1 are of I-type and were related predominantly by a fractional crystallization process. Least-square analysis of major elements and modelling of trace elements indicate that granodioritic enclaves and host G1 could be derived from the tonalitic enclave magma by fractional crystallization of plagioclase, grunerite, biotite and ilmenite. Granodiorite G2 is of hybrid origin. Most variation diagrams for granodioritic enclaves and host G3 granodiorite and their biotites show linear trends. Modelling of major and trace elements of granodioritic enclaves indicate that they result from mixing of relatively primitive granodiorite magma with magma derived from crustal melting. Tonalitic enclaves correspond to globules of a more mafic relatively primitive magma. Granite G4 has the most pronounced crustal signature and is of S-type. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) variation were surveyed ill the Spanish alpine endemic, Senecio boissieri, to resolve the causes of its disjunct distribution in the southern Sierra Nevada and Baza, centrally located Sierra Guadarrama, and northern Cordillera Cantabrica. RAPD analysis identified two divergent genetic groups, one containing individuals from the Cordillera Cantabrica and another comprising individuals from the three other mountain ranges. Chloroplast DNA variation was much more limited with only one of forty-two cpSSR loci examined showing polymorphism. At this locus the same allele occurred at high frequency in material from each mountain range. A possible reason for RAPD divergence in the Cantabrian material is its derivation from plants surviving the last glacial maximum ill a northern refugium, isolated from the main distribution of the species spanning the area between the southern and central Spanish sierras. Postglacial fragmentation of the species range in southern and central Iberia would have resulted in the Current disjunction of genetically similar populations in southern and centrally located mountains.									9	0	0	10	0	10			0040-0262			WOS:000269774900016	J	"Mendoza, Irene; Zamora, Regino; Castro, Jorge"				"Mendoza, Irene/A-3729-2012; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/G-1134-2014; Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014"	"Mendoza, Irene/0000-0002-8692-0507; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/0000-0002-3288-6366; Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240"			A seeding experiment for testing tree-community recruitment under variable environments: Implications for forest regeneration and conservation in Mediterranean habitats								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				142	7			1491	1499		10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.018			Jul-09	2009	As a result of historical and ecological factors, woody-plant communities are composed of species with different biogeographic origins that presumably diverge in their ability to recruit under variable environments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the conservation implications of the differences in recruitment of six tree species of different biogeographical origin coexisting in a Mediterranean mountain forest. Under field conditions, we experimentally sowed a total of 16,650 seeds belonging to two Mediterranean (Quercus ilex and Q. pyrenaica), two Sub-Mediterranean (Acer opalus subsp. granatense and Sorbus aria), and two boreo-alpine (Pinus sylvestris and Taxus baccata) species. We selected the three most common successional scenarios where seeds are dispersed (woodland, shrubland, and open areas), and half of the seeds were irrigated simulating a rainy summer in terms of Mediterranean ecosystems. Seedling survival was strongly affected by the type of habitat as well as irrigation. The recruitment of the six species was possible only in wooded areas under wet conditions (20-60%). In shrubland, only Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species recruited in typical dry years (10-50%), but irrigation increased their survival (25-65%) and allowed P. sylvestris to recruit (32%). Open areas constituted the most adverse scenario for seedling recruitment, especially for non-watered seedlings (0% for boreo-alpine species, 1-24% for the rest). Overall, the benefit of a wet summer was more critical for the recruitment of boreo-alpine species (P. sylvestris and T. baccata) than for the rest, although a rainy summer is also necessary for the recruitment of A. granatense and S. aria in shrubland habitats. Our experimental results indicate that the maintenance of current species composition in Mediterranean mountain forests is critically dependent on the periodic, scattered occurrence of wet summers. From a conservational standpoint, the predictions of less rainy summers and greater aridity in the future imply a change in the relative abundance of species in the mature forest, with Mediterranean species becoming dominant and boreo-alpine species becoming even rarer and, consequently, a serious threat for the persistence of boreo-alpine species at their southern distribution limit.

However, the expected upward shift of tree line ecotones in response to climate warming has not been ubiquitous. The lack of coupling between tree line dynamics and climate warming might be explained by factors other than climate variation that determine seedling recruitment in these ecotones. We want to assess how the availability of suitable habitat for establishment and the effects of facilitation on seedling survival and growth affect tree recruitment within tree line ecotones and modulate their responses to climate.Location We evaluate the relevance of these factors for Pinus uncinata tree line ecotones in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain) and Andorra.Methods We analysed the microhabitat of naturally established seedlings in rectangular plots at the tree line ecotone, assessing the habitat type and the proximity to potentially protective elements that may improve microsite conditions. We tested whether krummholz individuals influence regeneration at the tree line by performing a transplantation field experiment to evaluate the extent of facilitation on seedling survival and growth in height. A total of 820 seedlings were transplanted at different distances and orientations (resulting in 12 positions) from krummholz mats and monitored over 2 years.Results Safe sites for P. uncinata recruits consisted of sparse vegetation covering bare soil, gravel or litter, and close to protective elements that may ameliorate microsite conditions. The field experiment showed that directional positive interactions enhance seedling survival and growth, altering the spatial patterns of recruit survivor-ship, especially during harsh winter conditions (shallow and irregular snowpack).Main conclusions Our results suggest that scarce availability of safe sites and uneven facilitation by krummholz control seedling recruitment patterns within alpine tree line ecotones. Such constraints may distort or counter the response of tree line ecotones to climate warming at local and regional scales.									58	0	0	53	0	61			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000266923100007	J	"Matias, Luis; Mendoza, Irene; Zamora, Regino"				"Matias, Luis/B-4340-2011; Mendoza, Irene/A-3729-2012; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/G-1134-2014; Matias, Luis/K-6761-2014; Matias, Luis/H-6184-2015"	"Mendoza, Irene/0000-0002-8692-0507; Mendoza Sagrera, Irene/0000-0002-3288-6366; Matias, Luis/0000-0002-6245-1857; Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390"			Consistent pattern of habitat and species selection by post-dispersal seed predators in a Mediterranean mosaic landscape								PLANT ECOLOGY				203	1			137	147		10.1007/s11258-008-9518-7			Jul-09	2009	"There is still little information on effects of habitat degradation on post-dispersal seed predation at the landscape scale. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of habitat degradation and seed species on the variability of post-dispersal seed-predation rate. Experimental seed removal was investigated in six Mediterranean woody plant species, four trees (Pinus sylvestris, Quercus ilex, Acer opalus ssp. granatense, and Sorbus aria) and two shrubs (Berberis vulgaris and Crataegus monogyna), in an extensively used mosaic landscape on the Sierra Nevada massif (SE Spain). Seed depots were distributed over 2 years in five differently degraded landscape units, each one with three plots: shrubland; native forest; and dense, cleared and fenced reforestation stands. Predation was the highest in native forest, shrubland, and fenced reforestation, and the lowest in dense and cleared reforestation stands, being partially due to a positive correlation between shrub cover and post-dispersal seed predation. However, the main factors driving post-dispersal seed predation were intrinsic to seeds, as species preference explained most of the variance in our model for predation. The plant-species ranking was Quercus > Pinus > Sorbus > Berberis > Acer > Crataegus, the dominant tree species being the most depredated. These findings are novel because they suggest for the first time that species-selection patterns by post-dispersal seed predators tended to remain constant through both study years in all habitats comprising a mosaic landscape, whether native forest, reforestation stands or successional shrubland."									18	0	0	17	0	18			1385-0237	1573-5052		WOS:000266454700012	J	"Ibanez, Salvador; Gil-T., Felipe"								First records of the endemic Polyommatus golgus (Huebner, 1913) and Agriades zullichi (Hemming, 1933) in Almeria province (E.

This mountain range has peaks rising to 3500 m, and is located at latitude 37 degrees N, surrounded by a mild Mediterranean climate. Energy balance over the snowpack is subjected to very changeable weather conditions such as episodic strong low humidity winds, clear skies with very low nocturnal temperatures, intense solar radiation and sudden increases in temperatures. We found the behavior of the snow to be extremely variable throughout the year, especially in regards to melting cycles and evaporation. Simulations, based on snow water equivalent measurements, show that during 2004-2005. 42% of the total snow precipitation evaporated. Only 124 mm of the 300 mm of snowfall collected at the monitoring point actually melted. However, evaporation can range from 80% in December to 20% during the spring months and from 20% to 40% between years. The variability of the balance of energy fluxes acting on the snow cover in this basin means that all fluxes will be important at some point during the accumulation process. This is an excellent context for testing an energy balance model because of the widely diverse situations occurring at this location during the same time period. In order to calibrate the model, it was necessary to remove the stability-correction factors for non-adiabatic temperature gradients of the turbulent transfer, which are important for evaporation. The sensible-heat transfer coefficient in windless conditions is raised to 6 W/m(2) K. An empirical relationship for atmospheric emissivity calculation is derived from the observed relative humidity, as the well-known Brutsaert's formula clearly underestimated this value under cloudy skies.

This extension is programmed in Visual Basic 6 and uses the ArcObjects architecture of ArcGIS. It employs a new and easy methodology to extract the hypsometric curve by using the integer data-model properties of ArcGIS and summations algorithms. This provides an optimal integration within the program environment, allowing the representation and comparison of curves directly within the GIS main program. The CalHypso extension can also calculate the main statistics related to the hypsometric curve by applying polynomial fits. We have tested this tool in several basins of the eastern border of the Sierra-Nevada dome in the Betic Cordillera (SE Spain), showing important differences in the north- and south-slope hypsometric Curves. These variations are probably related to the tectonically controlled drainage evolution of the Southern border of Sierra Nevada. An eastward decrease in tectonic-driven erosion is also suggested by the hypsometric curves analyzed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous laboratory studies have shown that food quality is suboptimal for zooplankton growth. However, little is known about how food quality is affected by the interaction of potential global change factors in natural conditions. Using field enclosures in a high altitude Spanish lake, seston was exposed to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations in the absence and presence of UV radiation (UVR) to test the hypothesis that interactions between these factors affected the biochemical and stoichiometric composition of seston in ways not easily predicted from studies of single factors.2. Phosphorus enrichment increased the content of total fatty acids (TFA), omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA) and chlorophyll-a : carbon (Chl-a : C) and C : N ratios in seston. The pronounced increase in omega 3-PUFA was largely explained by the enhancement of 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid). In contrast, P-enrichment lowered the content of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), the HUFA : PUFA ratio and, at high P loads, seston C : P ratio. Although phytoplankton assemblages dominated by Chlorophytes were not rich in HUFA, seston in the control had substantially higher 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) content (79% of HUFA) than did P-enriched enclosures.3. The UVR increased the content of omega 3-PUFA and TFA in seston at the two ends of the trophic gradient generated at ambient and high concentrations of P, but decreased seston C : P and HUFA at all points on this gradient. ARA was not detected in the presence of UVR.4. The interaction between P and UVR was significant for seston HUFA and C : P ratios, indicating that the effect of UVR in reducing HUFA (decreased food quality) and C : P ratios (enhanced food quality) was most pronounced at the low nutrient concentrations characteristic of oligotrophic conditions and disappeared as P increased. Therefore, any future increase in UVR fluxes will probably affect most strongly the food quality of algae inhabiting oligotrophic pristine waters although, at least in the Mediterranean region, these effects could be offset by greater deposition of P from the atmosphere.									15	0	0	15	0	15			0046-5070			WOS:000265934700007	J	"Antonio Delgado-Molina, Jose; Carrillo, Presentacion; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel; Jose Bullejos, Francisco"				"Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015"				Interactive effects of phosphorus loads and ambient ultraviolet radiation on the algal community in a high-mountain lake								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				31	6			619	634		10.1093/plankt/fbp018			Jun-09	2009	Interactions among multiple stressors generated by global change exert cumulative effects on ecosystems. In order to identify the long-term interactive effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and increasing atmospheric nutrient inputs (P-inputs) on aggregate (growth rate, chlorophyll a and abundance) and emergent (evenness and diversity) algal community variables, a 2 x 5 factorial experiment [two levels of light quality (+UVR, -UVR) and five levels of nutrient enrichment] was conducted using in situ mesocosms in a high-mountain lake in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over a 70-day period. Addition of P suppressed and inverted the stimulatory UVR effect on the non-flagellate growth rate (mid-term scale). This interactive effect was propagated as increased harmful UVR effect on chlorophyll a and abundance across the P-gradient. Interestingly, P-pulse reversed the positive effect of UVR on phytoplankton evenness and diversity on the long-term scale. These findings support our hypothesis that the UVR x P interactive effect would favor a few UVR-tolerant rapid-growing species. We show that the algal community is acclimated to UVR-flux but not to high P-pulse. The loss of diversity and disappearance of mixotrophic flagellates may have important implications for the functioning of clear-water ecosystems.									8	1	0	9	0	9			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000265741700003	J	Wagner, Wolfgang								Observations on foodplants of caterpillars of Pyrgus onopordi (Rambur 1839) in Andalusien (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae).

Nachrichten des Entomologischen Vereins Apollo				30	01-Feb			1	4					Juni 2009	2009	During a journey to Andalusia (southern Spain) in the end of June 2008 the author made some very interesting observations on ovipositing females of Pyrgus onopordi (RAMBUR 1839). In the Sierra Nevada the butterflies were encountered in more than 2500 m elevation where they laved their eggs underneath the foliage of Malva neglecta (Malvaceae) near ground. The same behaviour and additional eggs could be observed at around 1000 m in the Sierra de Cazorla. Other females were ovipositing on Helianthemum apenninum (Cistaceae, in Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra Nevada) and Potentilla reptans (Rosaceae, Sierra Nevada). From all plants, some larvae have been reared to Imago in order to confirm determination. The usage of the genus Malva is new for European Pyrgus species. In Northern America several species develop on these plants, but records from Europe were considered to be erroneous so far. This is still true as long as species like Pyrgus sidae (ESPER 1784), P. carthami (HUBNER 1813) and P andromedae (WALLENGREN 1853) are concerned and is probably due to confounding the caterpillars with those of Carcharodus alceae (ESPER 1780, Hesperiidae) in former centuries.									1	0		1	0	1			0723-9912			ZOOREC:ZOOR14510063263	J	"Sarasa, Mathieu; Serrano, Emmanuel; Gonzalez, Georges; Granados, Jose-Enrique; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Perez, Jesus M.; Joachim, Jean"				"Sarasa, Mathieu/H-1002-2011; CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Serrano, Emmanuel/J-4489-2013; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014"	"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Serrano, Emmanuel/0000-0002-9799-9804; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766"			Pseudoectoparasites: a new tool for exploring the relationship between host behaviour and ectoparasites								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				77	5			1351	1356		10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.01.005			May-09	2009										5	0	0	3	0	5			Mar-72			WOS:000265283900046	J	"Pedrera, Antonio; Vicente Perez-Pena, Jose; Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus; Miguel Azanon, Jose; Azor, Antonio"				"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/K-3640-2012; Azor, Antonio/K-9761-2014; Perez-Pena, Jose/M-2070-2014; Pedrera, Antonio/L-6463-2014"	"Galindo-Zaldivar, Jesus/0000-0002-3493-2637; Perez-Pena, Jose/0000-0001-8880-7375; Azanon, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-7834-5816; Pedrera, Antonio/0000-0003-1990-9292"			Testing the sensitivity of geomorphic indices in areas of low-rate active folding (eastern Betic Cordillera, Spain)								GEOMORPHOLOGY				105	03-Apr			218	231		10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.09.026			APR 15 2009	2009	Active deformation structures have an incidence in topography that can be quantified by using geomorphic indices. Most of these indices have been checked in faulted regions with high-deformation rates. The application of several geomorphic indices (hypsometric curve analysis, normalized stream-length gradient, and valley width-to-valley height ratio) to the drainage network of the southern limb of the Sierra de Las Estancias antiform (Internal Zones, eastern Betic Cordillera), where low-rate active folding has been recognized, allows us to investigate the suitability of these indices to identify active structures in such a scenario. Hypsometric curves clearly identify regions with recent uplift and young topography, but they do not provide any constraint on the location of active folds. Local valley width-to-valley height index variations have been detected just coinciding whit the position of ENE-WSW active folds. Normalized stream-length gradient index serves to locate active folds in areas of hard rock substratum, but not in those areas with soft sediments (Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary basins). This is most likely due to the fact that in the basins erosion is much more intense than in the hard rock sectors. In view of these results. we consider that geomorphic indices constitute a valuable tool for identifying sectors affected by low-rate uplift related to active folding, with the best results obtained in hard rock areas.

The landscape is a mosaic composed of native forest and two degraded landscape units: reforestation stands and shrubland.We evaluated fruit production, seed rain, seedling emergence and seedling survival in two consecutive years with contrasting rainfall patterns. Seed and seedling data were used to calculate values of seed and establishment limitation.In general, the woody community was both severely seed- and establishment-limited. Species were less seed-limited in the landscape units with higher adult density (i.e. shrub species in shrubland, Pinus spp. in reforestation stands). In contrast, degradation did not exacerbate establishment limitation, which was severe in all landscape units. This general pattern was modulated by the biogeographical distribution, dispersal type, and life form of the species. Boreo-alpine species were more limited in establishment than species with a typical Mediterranean distribution. Zoochorous species were less seed-limited in the landscape units preferred by dispersers (i.e. native forest). Tree species were more establishment-limited than shrub species, irrespective of the landscape unit. Seed limitation, and especially establishment limitation, varied among years, with establishment being almost nil in the very dry year.In the case of Mediterranean landscapes, when degradation from human impact involves a reduction in the adult abundance of the woody plant community (trees and shrubs), seed limitation increases, although establishment limitation is generally high in all landscape units, especially for boreo-alpine species. Conservation and restoration strategies should take into account our results showing that tree species were unable to recruit in an extremely dry year, because more aridity is expected under a climatic change scenario in Mediterranean ecosystems.									35	0	0	33	0	35			1100-9233			WOS:000264568200018	J	"Lopez Sanchez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Teresa Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria; Garrido, Carlos J.; Alberto Padron-Navarta, Jose; Mellini, Marcello"				"Padron-Navarta, Jose Alberto/D-5400-2009; Garrido, Carlos J./A-6249-2008; Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria Teresa/C-8890-2015; LOPEZ SANCHEZ-VIZCAINO, VICENTE/A-1974-2010"	"Padron-Navarta, Jose Alberto/0000-0001-8202-0037; Garrido, Carlos J./0000-0003-4357-3637; Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-4730-9139; LOPEZ SANCHEZ-VIZCAINO, VICENTE/0000-0003-0762-3692"			Breakdown mechanisms of titanclinohumite in antigorite serpentinite (Cerro del Almirez massif, S.

Spain). They formed at estimated maximum P-T conditions of 1.3 GPa and 475 degrees C, due to simultaneous breakdown of former Ti-rich clinopyroxene and brucite in the presence of 6 vol.% of free water. Breakdown of Ti-Chu single crystals to an olivine+ ilmenite framework was gradual: small relict patches of Ti-Chu appear even at some distance from the reaction front and ilmenite grains coarsen and become less frequent away from the front Detailed TEM data support this interpretation: olivine in equilibrium with Ti-Chu is structurally and chemically homogeneous, whereas Ti-Chu shows ubiquitous intermixed (001) olivine lamellae. Product olivine close to the front shows pervasive and continuous (001) Ti-Chu lamellar faults. These become less frequent away from the reaction front, due to the completion of the Ti-Chu breakdown. This textural sequence suggests both progressive transfer of Ti to ilmenite and progressive release of H(2)O during the breakdown of Ti-Chu. A second hydration breakdown reaction can be observed very locally, in the contact between Ti-Chu and diopside, producing a symplectitic intergrowth of tremolite and ilmenite. Textural features of both reactions point to a very limited availability of water during Ti-Chu breakdown. This suggests that veins operated as closed systems. Complete obliteration of Ti-Chu owing to the antigorite dehydration breakdown can be observed in the Almirez massif rocks. This precludes OH-Ti-Chu from Atg-serpentinite as an efficient water or titanium carrier into deep mantle in hot subduction zones. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) of three distantly related alpine plant species co-occurring in the Spanish Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees and the southwestern Alps/Massif Central to establish divergence rates. Within each of these species (Gentiana alpina, Kernera saxatilis and Silene rupestris), we found that the degree of AFLP divergence (D(N72)) between mountain phylogroups was significantly correlated with their time of divergence (as inferred from palaeoclimatic/palynological data), indicating constant AFLP divergence rates. As these rates did not differ significantly among species, a regression analysis based on the pooled data was utilized to generate a general AFLP rate. The application of this latter rate to AFLP data from other herbaceous plant species (Minuartia biflora: Schonswetter et al. 2006; Nigella degenii: Comes et al. 2008) resulted in a plausible timing of the recolonization of the Svalbard Islands and the separation of populations from the Alps and Scandinavia (Minuartia), and of island population separation in the Aegean Archipelago (Nigella). Furthermore, the AFLP mutation rate obtained in our study is of the same magnitude as AFLP mutation rates published previously. The temporal limits of our AFLP rate, which is based on intraspecific vicariance events at shallow (i.e. late glacial/Early Holocene) time scales, remains to be tested."									32	0	0	32	0	33			0962-1083			WOS:000262782400010	19175503B	"de Matias Bejarano, Javier; Moreno del Pozo, Jose; Guerrero Campo, Jose J."

This type of models has particular properties which make it a special application for multi-view stereo reconstruction algorithms. In this work we analize different types of methods for dense reconstruction from wide base-line views. Besides that we select a method which was adapted and implemented for the specific case of rock glacier modelling. Principally we add two suitable innovations: implement a pyramidal image structure for get more efficient computation and use a feature-based method to obtain a initial terrain surface and improve the depth estimation. The proposed method has been tested in a real rock glacier example (Veleta in Sierra Nevada, Spain) with good results.					15th International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia15th International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia	SEP 09-12, 2009SEP 09-12, 2009	"VSMM; TU Vienna; IAPR; Austrian Comp Soc; Austrian Official CarrierVSMM; TU Vienna; IAPR; Austrian Comp Soc; Austrian Official Carrier"	Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna Univ Technol, Vienna, AUSTRIA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7695-3790-0	WOS:000289587500026	J	"Fanes Trevino, Ingrid; Comas Gonzalez, Augusto; Sanchez Castillo, Pedro M."

The attainment of isotopic equilibrium during melting of crustal rocks is implicitly assumed in most isotopic dating and tracing studies. This assumption considers the melting event as an instantaneous process and does not take into account the duration of anatexis. To assess the critical role of the timescale of crustal melting, we have studied the unique occurrence of erupted migmatites enclosed as xenoliths in the El Hoyazo and Mazarron dacites of the Neogene Volcanic Province of SE Spain. These xenoliths represent the residue after some 30-60 % rhyolitic melt extraction at P-T conditions of 5-7 kbar and similar to 850 degrees C, and consist of biotite, plagioclase, sillimanite, garnet, cordierite, graphite and abundant glass inclusions (i.e., not extracted rhyolitic melt) within each mineral phase. The timescale of melt extraction was similar to 3 Myr and < 0.8 Myr at El Hoyazo and Mazarron, respectively, resembling the duration of melting events during rapid anatexis caused by basalt underplating and crustal assimilation processes.In both localities, the minerals and glass inclusions of erupted migmatites preserve a significant Sr and minor Nd isotope disequilibrium. At Mazarron the isotopic disequilibrium is most marked owing to the shorter residence time of the melt within the source. The isotopic disequilibrium is not caused by the major xenolith-forming minerals but rather by the accessory phosphate inclusions (apatite +/- monazite +/- xenotime) hosted in garnet and biotite. The preservation of isotopic disequilibrium in these accessory phases has been facilitated by both their intrinsically low Sr and Nd diffusion coefficients and the armouring effect caused by their occurrence within biotite and garnet crystals, which acted as chemical barriers to Sr and Nd diffusion. This result implies that modelling of radiogenic isotope equilibration in natural systems should consider elemental diffusion in a composite medium with a resistance at the interface, i.e. different partition coefficients between adjacent mineral phases.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0935-1221			WOS:000263454400014	J	"Perez-Aranda, Diana; Suarez, Francisco; Soriguer, Ramon C."

At the intraspecies level, this variety is seen not only between populations, but also within single populations whose spatial organization system changes over time according to the local environmental and social conditions. Taking into account such phenotypic flexibility in microtine social organization patterns, our aim was to study spatial patterns among the snow vole Chionomys nivalis (Martins, 1842) in two study colonies, located in the Sierra Nevada (Andalusia) and Penalara (Madrid), respectively. We used radiotracking techniques to study snow vole home ranges. Animals were monitored in August 2005 in the Sierra Nevada and in August 2006 in Penalara. Home range estimates were based on a kernel application since it provided the model best fitted to the particular set of snow vole locations. We observed clear spatial segregation of individuals with a varying degree of overlap between their home ranges in both localities. Nevertheless, there were also differences between the two populations which suggest that the space use pattern in the Sierra Nevada is related to poorer habitat resources (e.g. food and mates) than is the case in Penalara. Finally, we discuss the most probable mating system in Penalara based on the characteristics of the space use pattern observed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1137-8700			ZOOREC:ZOOR14602011607	J	"Gomez-Ortiz, Antonio; Palacios, David; Schulte, Lothar; Salvador-Franch, Ferran; Plana-Castellvi, Josep A."

These species grow on siliceous bedrock: C. alpina in the Alps and Pyrenees, and C. resedifolia in several mountain ranges from the Sierra Nevada to the Balkans. We explore differentiation among their disjunct populations as well as within the contiguous Alpine and Pyrenean ranges, and compare the phylogeographical histories of these diploid sister species. We also include samples of the closely related, arctic diploid C. bellidifolia in order to explore its origin and post-glacial establishment.European alpine system, Norway and Iceland.We employed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). AFLP data were analysed using principal coordinates analysis, neighbour joining and Bayesian clustering, and measures of diversity and differentiation were computed.For the snow-bed species C. alpina (27 populations, 203 plants) we resolved two strongly divergent lineages, corresponding to the Alps and the Pyrenees. Although multiple glacial refugia were invoked in the Pyrenees, we inferred only a single one in the Maritime Alps - from which rapid post-glacial colonization of the entire Alps occurred, accompanied by a strong founder effect. For C. resedifolia (33 populations, 247 plants), which has a broader ecological amplitude and a wider distribution, the genetic structuring was rather weak and did not correspond to the main geographical disjunctions. This species consists of two widespread and largely sympatric main genetic groups (one of them subdivided into four geographically more restricted groups), and frequent secondary contacts exist between them.The conspicuously different histories of these two sister species are likely to be associated with their different ecologies. The more abundant habitats available for C. resedifolia may have increased the probability of its gradual migration during colder periods and also of successful establishment after long-distance dispersal, whereas C. alpina has been restricted by its dependence on snow-beds. Surprisingly, the arctic C. bellidifolia formed a very divergent lineage with little variation, contradicting a scenario of recent, post-glacial migration from the Alps or Pyrenees.									12	0	0	10	0	12			0305-0270			WOS:000261620400011	J	"Figueroa, Felix L.; Korbee, Nathalie; Carrillo, Presentacion; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Mata, Mayte; Bonomi, Jose; Sanchez-Castillo, Pedro M."

The maximal electron transport rate was 3.5-5 times higher in algae growing at 0.25-0.5 m respectively than that at 0.1 and 1 m depth. These results are related to the accumulation of phenolic compounds: i.e. the algae at 0.25-0.5 in presentedrespectively about a 3-5 times higher concentration of phenolic compounds than that of algae at 0.1-1 m depth. The protection mechanisms seem to be stimulated by UVB radiation, since F-v/F-m was higher in the presence of UVB (PAB treatment) compared to PA or P treatments. UVA exerts the main photoinhibitory effect, not Only at midday, but also in the afternoon. UVB radiation also had a protective effect in algae grown under desiccation conditions for three days. During re-hydration, the rapid increase of F-v/F-m (after 1 h) was higher in the UVB-grown algae than in algae grown under UVA radiation. After 5 h. F-v/F-m values were similar in algae submitted to desiccation/rehydration under PAB and P treatments as they were in the control (submerged algae). The combined effect of desiccation and UVA produced the greatest decrease of photosynthesis in Z. decussata. Thifs UVB, in contrast to other species, may support the recovery process. Z. decussata can acclimate to severe stress, conditions in this high mountain lake by the photoprotection mechanism induced by UVB radiation through dynamic photoinhibition and the accumulation of phenolic compounds (UV screen and antioxidant substances)."									10	0	1	11	1	11			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000268778300005	J	"Clark, S.

The record of tectonic denudation and erosion in an emerging orogen: an apatite fission-track study of the Sierra Nevada, southern Spain								JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY				166				87	100		10.1144/0016-76492008-041			Jan-09	2009	Apatite fission-track analysis of rocks from the Sierra Nevada basement, southern Spain reveals a detailed record of Neogene denudation. This is combined with evidence of the accumulation of elastic sedimentary rocks in the adjacent Granada Basin to provide a comprehensive record of the denudation of the emerging mountain block. Fission-track ages of c. 9-10 and 4 Ma obtained front the basement reveal periods of rapid cooling linked to tectonic denudation of the metamorphic core. The first major Pulse of erosion from the Sierra Nevada produced proximal conglomerates in the marine basin and is constrained at c. 7 Ma using Sr-isotope stratigraphy. No major signal of rapid cooling is preserved by the fission-track systems in the basement block associated with this event. Apatite fission-track data from the conglomerates show young ages and short track lengths indicative of reheating. Modelling of the data suggests that heating occurred at around 4 Ma and is linked to movement of hot fluids through the basin. The ability of thermochronometers to record erosional events during the early stages of orogenesis is critically examined and we suggest that in young rising Mountain blocks surface processes are incapable of keeping pace with rock Uplift, and denudation principally occurs via tectonic processes.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0016-7649			WOS:000262572600009	J	"Mladenov, Natalie; Pulido-Villena, Elvira; Morales-Baquero, Rafael; Ortega-Retuerta, Eva; Sommaruga, Ruben; Reche, Isabel"				"Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; "	"Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899"			Spatiotemporal drivers of dissolved organic matter in high alpine lakes: Role of Saharan dust inputs and bacterial activity								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES				113						G00D01	10.1029/2008JG000699			DEC 23 2008	2008	"The effects of many environmental stressors such as UV radiation are mediated by dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties. Therefore, determining the factors shaping spatial and temporal patterns is particularly essential in the most susceptible, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lakes. We analyzed spatiotemporal variations in dissolved organic carbon concentration and dissolved organic matter optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) in 11 transparent lakes located above tree line in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain), and we assessed potential external (evaporation and atmospheric deposition) and internal (bacterial abundance, bacterial production, chlorophyll a, and catchment vegetation) drivers of DOM patterns. At spatial and temporal scales, bacteria were related to chromophoric DOM (CDOM). At the temporal scale, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in dust deposition and evaporation were found to have a significant influence on DOC and CDOM in two Sierra Nevada lakes studied during the ice-free periods of 2000-2002. DOC concentrations and absorption coefficients at 320 nm were strongly correlated over the spatial scale (n = 11, R(2) = 0.86; p < 0.01), but inconsistently correlated over time, indicating seasonal and interannual variability in external factors and a differential response of DOC concentration and CDOM to these factors. At the continental scale, higher mean DOC concentrations and more CDOM in lakes of the Sierra Nevada than in lakes of the Pyrenees and Alps may be due to a combination of more extreme evaporation, and greater atmospheric dust deposition."									14	0	0	12	0	14			0148-0227			WOS:000262042100001	J	"Pont, Adrian C.; Gregor, Frantisek"								A new species of the genus Coenosia Meigen, 1826 (Diptera: Muscidae) from the Sierra Nevada, Spain.

However, sometimes it is important to evaluate the nutritional status of the animal by means of blood and serum analyses and the interpretation of specific parameters. Only in a very few studies is the nutritional status of the animal obtained by blood biochemistry and, when obtained, compared with the values for body condition obtained by anatomic dissection. In this study, the usefulness of two serum parameters, total serum proteins (TSP) and serum triglycerides (ST), was assessed in the monitoring of the body condition of Iberian wild goats (Capra pyrenaica). In addition, their relationship with the kidney fat index (KFI) and its components, kidney mass without fat (KM) and kidney fat (KF) is evaluated. A total of 25 wild goats from the Sierra Nevada National Park (southern Iberian Peninsula) that were shot by hunters were used in this study. The parameter TSP was found to be correlated with KM. and ST was correlated with both KM and KFI. Hence. both TSP and ST can be used for monitoring physical condition in wild and captive Iberian wild goats.									7	0	0	5	0	7			1042-7260			WOS:000261706300021	19110711J	"Alasaad, S.; Soglia, D.; Sarasa, M.; Soriguer, R.

Ten microsatellite primers were applied on 44 individual S. scabiei mites from three mangy Iberian ibexes from Sierra Nevada Mountain in Spain. Dendrograms of the mites from the individual Iberian ibexes, showing the proportion of shared alleles between pairs of individual mites representing three skin subpopulations (head, back, and abdomen subunits), allowed the clustering of some mite samples up to their skin subunits. This genetic diversity of S. scabiei at skin-scale did not have the same pattern in all considered hosts: for the first Iberian ibex (Cp1), only mites from the head subunit were grouped together; in the second individual (Cp2), the clustering was detected only for mites from the abdomen subunit; and for the third one (Cp3), only mites from the back subunit were clustered together. Our results suggest that the local colonization dynamics of S. scabiei would have influenced the nonrandom distribution of this ectoparasite, after a single infestation. Another presumable explanation to this skin-scale genetic structure could be the repeated infestations. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of genetic structuring among S. scabiei at individual host skin-scale. Further studies are warranted to highlight determining factors of such trend, but the pattern underlined in the present study should be taken into account in diagnosis and monitoring protocols for studying the population genetic structure and life cycle of this neglected but important ectoparasite."									24	0	0	17	0	24			0932-0113			WOS:000260542300012	18758821J	"Arboleya, Maria-Luisa; Babault, Julien; Owen, Lewis A.; Teixell, Antonio; Finkel, Robert C."

Alluvial fan and terrace incision was controlled partially by a drop in base level during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene as the outlet channel, the Draa river, progressively cut through the Anti-Atlas to the south of the Ouarzazate foreland basin, the drainage of which started to become external after a long period of internal drained conditions. The alluvial fans and terrace surfaces have abandonment ages that date to at least the past four glacial cycles. Their formation was strongly modulated by climate on glacial-interglacial time scales as base level dropped. This demonstrates a strong climatic control on sediment transfer in other intracontinental mountain belts. Furthermore, these data show that mean rates of fluvial incision in this region range between 0.3 and 1.0 mm a(-1) for the latter part of the Quaternary. This study provides the first comprehensive TCN chronology for the Atlas Mountains, and it illustrates the applicability and limitations of TCN methods.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0016-7649	2041-479X		WOS:000261271200006	J	"Negro, F.; de Sigoyer, J.; Goffe, B.; Saddiqi, O.; Villa, I.

The Ternsamane units, in spite of their external position in the Rif (northern Morocco), underwent medium-pressure low-temperature (MP-LT) conditions (ca. 7-9 kbar; 330-430 degrees C). We propose a new tectonic and metamorphic evolution scenario for the Rif (southern) branch of the orogen on the basis of first (40)Ar/(39)Ar dating on petrologically and structurally characterized white micas. Three groups of (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages are observed: (1) Chattian or older Si-rich (highest-pressure) mica relics, (2) 15-12.5 Ma corresponding to the micas defining the foliation and (3) Messinian or younger late micas and alteration. We propose that the MP-LT metamorphic event in the External Rif is Oligocene in age, highlighting a subduction event during this period which could be almost contemporaneous with the burial of HP-LT units from the internal Rif (Alboran Domain). The exhumation of these units characterized by an intense E-W stretching and by top-to-the-west shear senses, is Middle to Late Miocene in age. We propose a correlation of tectonic and metamorphic events at the Betic-Rif arc scale. We argue that the exhumation of the external units of the Rif (1) is younger than that of the Alboran Domain (internal) unit of the Rif, and mirrors a different tectonic setting, but (2) strongly resembles to that documented in the lower Alboran Domain units of the Betics. We show that a regional E-W extension is recorded on both sides of the Betic-Rif arc during the Middle Miocene. This extension probably reflects back-arc deformation of an eastward dipping subduction that retreated westward during the Middle to Late Miocene in the Western Mediterranean. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The reliability of this record is supported by comparison with that of Padul (Sierra Nevada, Spain). Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterised by fluctuations in Quercus forest cover in response to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate variability. MIS 2 was characterised by the dominance of semi-desert vegetation. Despite overall dry and cold conditions during MIS 2, Heinrich events (HEs) 2 and 1 were distinguished from the last glacial maximum by more intensely and conditions. Taxon-specific vegetation responses to a tripartite climatic structure within the HEs are observed. In MIS 1, the Bolling-Allerod was marked by rapid afforestation, while a re-expansion of semi-desert environments occurred during the Younger Dryas. The maximum development of mixed Quercus forest occurred between 11.7 and 5.4 cal ka BP, with forest decline since 5.4 cal ka BP. On orbital timescales, a long-term expansion of semi-desert vegetation from MIS 3 into MIS 2 reflects global ice-volume trends, while Holocene arboreal decline reflects summer insolation decrease. The influence of precession on the amplitude of forest development and vegetation composition is also detected. (C) 2008 University of Washington.

In generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated selection on corolla shape is even more difficult. In this study, we explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (large bees, small bees and bee flies) discriminate between different corolla shapes when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow petals, whereas bee flies prefer flowers with rounded overlapping petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the populations where large or small bees are the most abundant pollinator groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without specialization.									55	1	0	53	0	55			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000258440500009	18544510J	"Zuazo, Victor Hugo Duran; Pleguezuelo, Carmen Rocio Rodriguez; Martinez, Jose Ramon Francia; Raya, Armando Martinez; Panadero, Lorenzo Arroyo; Rodriguez, Belen Carceles; Moll, Maria Concepcion Navarro"								Benefits of plant strips for sustainable mountain agriculture								AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT				28	4			497	505		10.1051/agro:2008020			OCT-DEC 2008	2008	"Erosion degrades soil quality in agricultural ecosystems, thereby reducing the productivity of the land. Semi-natural vegetation and diverse cropping systems have been converted into monocultures with low tree densities, leaving the soil unprotected. We evaluated the association in soil-and water-conservation systems with production in traditional almond orchards and the beneficial impact of plant strips in mountainous agriculture. Soil loss, runoff and nutrient loss over a four-year period (2002-2005) were monitored in hillside erosion plots with almond trees under different soil-management systems: (1) non-tillage with sage (Salvia lavandulifolia L. subspecies Oxyodon) strips 3 m wide; (2) non-tillage with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) strips, (3) non-tillage with thyme (Thymus baeticus L. Boiss. exlacaita) strips, and (4) conventional tillage on the south flank of the Sierra Nevada (Lanjaron) in south-eastern Spain. Also, the nut yield from almond trees, and the biomass from aromatic-shrub strips were measured. The erosion plots, located on a 35% slope, were 144 m(2) in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. Our results show that the most effective treatment proved to be non-tillage with thyme strips, reducing the annual soil loss by 93% and runoff by 80%, with respect to conventional tillage. Non-tillage with rosemary strips reduced soil loss by 91% and runo. by 82%, with respect to conventional tillage, while these percentages were 69% and 51%, respectively, for non-tillage with sage strips. In addition, all the treatments as a whole, in comparison with conventional tillage, revealed that the plant strips were the decisive factor in the reduction of NPK losses by surface runoff. The average nut yield from non-tillage with sage strips, non-tillage with rosemary strips, non-tillage with thyme strips and conventional tillage during the study period was 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 and 4.5 kg tree(-1), respectively, and the essential oil yield from sage, rosemary and thyme strips was 5.0, 8.7 and 10.8 L ha(-1), respectively. The non-tillage with thyme strips decreased nutrient loading in surface waters and thus had a positive impact on the environment while simultaneously maintaining reasonable almond-production levels. Thus, the combination of orchard trees with shrubs provided a viable option to conserve soil and water in hilly areas with opportunities to increase overall land productivity as well as sustainable agro-environmental measures."									8	0	0	6	1	9			1774-0746			WOS:000260560200006	J	"Gomez, Jose M.; Hodar, Jose A."

We experimentally determine the effect of damage by wild boars (Sus scrofa) in recruitment rate and spatial pattern of a Mediterranean tree, the holm oak (Quercus ilex). We monitored oak establishment in the Sierra Nevada of southeastern Spain during 4 years (1999-2002) in four plots, two fenced and two unfenced that were used as controls. In addition, we planted 1-year-old seedlings in all microhabitats, both in fenced and control plots. to experimentally determine the effect of wild boar on their microhabitat-dependent survival. Despite seedling abundance being similar inside and outside the fences, sapling abundance diminished up to 50% in unfenced plots compared to fenced plots. Wild boars also seemed to modify the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings. Whereas seedlings were most abundant under pines both in fenced and control plots, sapling abundance was highest under pine trees in fenced plots, but similarly abundant under pines or shrubs in control plots. This change in spatial pattern was due to the effect of wild boars killing seedlings when looking for food under pines. The effects of the different mortality factors were not additive. Where ungulates are absent, recruitment is high and occurs under oaks and especially under pines. Where wild boars are present, recruitment diminishes and occurs mostly under shrubs and pines. Wild boars arrest population growth and modify the spatial pattern of recruitment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature was hourly registered. We studied life cycles and larval feeding of four mayfly species [Serratella ignita (Poda, 1761), Serratella spinosa nevadensis (Alba-Tercedor, 1981), Alainites muticus (Linnaeus, 1758), and Baetis alpinus Pictet, 1843] and two stonefly species [Amphinemura triangularis (Ris, 1902) and Capnioneura mitis Despax, 1932]. Some species changed their strategies (growth rate, life cycle duration, and/or voltinism) in accordance with different conditions (depending on the altitude and temperature). The gut content data showed that species fed mainly on detritus (as collector-gatherers or as shredders), except B. alpinus that behaved as a scraper in one of the streams. Differences in the larval diet of the same species in different streams, and even through its life, support the idea of not using general models to extrapolate the function of a species from a higher taxonomical level.									15	1	0	15	0	16			0018-8158			WOS:000257392300024	J	"Casas, J.

From 1991 to 1995, pupal exuviae were collected at irregular intervals in the permanent stream, but the temporary stream was dry because of a long-lasting drought in the region. From March 1996 to March 2000, pupal exuviae were collected fortnightly in both streams. In contrast to other comparative studies that found more species in permanent than in temporary streams, our 2 streams harbored similar temporal I and a diversity during the 1996 to 2000 study period. This result might be explained by the relatively long time the temporary stream was flowing. In addition, the temporary stream showed higher temporal P diversity than the permanent stream, a result that might be attributable to the greater variability in temperature and substrates in the temporary stream. Spates scarcely affected alpha diversity and favored colonization by new species in both streams, a result that supports the patch-dynamic concept of streams. A period of >1 y without spates also resulted in colonization by new species in the permanent stream, but led to a pool phase in the temporary stream that reduced cc diversity considerably. Overall, both streams had similar chironomid species richness and species rarity and high faunal complementarity. These results support the view that temporary aquatic habitats deserve consideration in conservation plans designed to protect species and their habitats.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0887-3593			WOS:000258851800021	J	"Gomez Ortiz, Antonio; Salvador Franch, Ferran; Schulte, Lothar; Sanjose Blasco, Jose Juan; Atkinson Gordo, Alan; Palacios Estremera, David"								Morphodynamic evolution in recent deglaciated high mountain areas: The case of the Veleta Cirque, Sierra Nevada.

No samples were positive for antibodies to Y. pestis. Positive PCR results included one yellow-pine chipmunk for Y. pestis (C-T = 32.8), one golden-mantled ground squirrel for R. rickettsii (C-T = 33), and one flea found to be co-infected with both R. rickettsii (C-T = 17) and A. phagocytophilum (C-T = 36).

The implementation of such renewable energy systems is especially important in places like natural parks, where acoustic and fossil fuel derived contamination has to be completely avoided. Measure of solar radiation is usually accomplished by means of radiometric station nets with a low spatial resolution. To estimate the radiation in sites located away from the stations, different interpolation/extrapolation techniques may be used. These methods are valid on places where the spatial variability of radiation is not significant, but becomes less accurate if complex terrain areas are present in between the radiometric stations. As an alternative, artificial intelligence techniques have been used in this work, along with a 20 in resolution digital model of terrain. The inputs to the network have been selected using the automatic relevance determination methodology. The data set contains 3 years' data of daily global radiation measured at 12 different stations located in the north face of the Sierra Nevada National Park in the surroundings of Hueneja (Granada), a town located in the South East of Spain. The stations altitude varies from 1000 to 1700 m. The goal of this work has been to estimate daily global irradiation on stations located in a complex terrain, and the values estimated by the neural network model have been compared with the measured ones leading to a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.0% and a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.2%, both expressed as a percentage of the mean value. Performance achieved individually for each of the stations lies in the range [5.0-7.5]% for the RMSE and [-1.2 to +2.11% for the MBE. Results point out artificial neural networks as an efficient and easy methodology for calculating solar radiation levels over complex mountain terrains from only one radionnetric station data. In addition, this methodology can be applied to other areas with a complex topography. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

During the LIA, three different glacial environments have been differentiated in these three ranges. A high mountain glacial environment exists in the Pyrenees, where the altitude and northern latitude developed the most complex glacial environment between the oceanic influence on the western side and the Mediterranean influence on the eastern side. In the Pyrenees the LIA glaciation occurred in 15 massifs where there are up to 100 cirques; however, today the glaciers remain only in the highest peaks. A marginal glacial environment exists in the Picos de Europa related to the oceanic influence and topography in an Atlantic high mountain: there were six glaciers in the Picos de Europa Massif during the LIA. A marginal glacial environment also exists in the Sierra Nevada, related to the northern orientation and altitude in a Mediterranean high mountain, where only one glacier, the southernmost of Europe, occurred during the LIA. Several variations of LIA glaciers have been found: historical maximum (from the end of the seventeenth to the beginning of the eighteenth centuries); minor retreat with secondary regrowth (mid-eighteenth to nineteenth centuries); and continuous retreat (from the end of the nineteenth to the beginning of the twentieth centuries); followed by the almost complete extinction of the glaciers and an increase in the periglacial environment. There are now 29 glaciers in the Pyrenees, four buried icepatches in the Picos de Europa and one buried icepatch in the Sierra Nevada. The rise of ELAs from the last LIA glacial maximum until the present allows the calculation of an increase in temperatures of around 0.9 degrees C in the Iberian high mountains."									37	0	0	13	0	37			0959-6836			WOS:000256882300005	J	Cano Villegas, Francisco J.

The study focuses on the Granada aquifer system which is located in an intramontane basin bounded by high mountain ranges providing elevation differences of almost 2900 m. These altitude gradients lead to important temperature and precipitation gradients and provide excellent conditions for the application of stable isotopes of water whose composition depends mainly on temperature. Samples of rain, snow, surface water and groundwater were collected at 154 locations for stable isotope studies (delta O-18, D) and, in the case of ground- and surface waters, also for major and minor ion analysis. Thirty-seven springs were sampled between 2 and 5 times from October 2004 to March 2005 along an altitudinal gradient from 552 masl in the Granada basin to 2156 masl in Sierra Nevada. Nine groundwater samples were taken from the discharge of operating wells in the Granada basin which are all located between 540 and 728 masl. The two main rivers were monitored every 2-3 weeks at three different altitudes. Rainfall being scarce during the sampling period, precipitation could only be sampled during four rainfall events. Calculated recharge altitudes of springs showed that source areas of mainly snowmelt recharge are generally located between 1600 and 2000 masl. The isotope compositions of spring water indicate water sources from the western Mediterranean as well as from the Atlantic without indicating a seasonal trend. The isotope pattern of the Quaternary aquifer reflects the spatial separation of different sources of recharge which occur mainly by bankfiltration of the main rivers. Isotopic signatures in the southeastern part of the aquifer indicate a considerable recharge contribution by subsurface flow discharged from the adjacent carbonate aquifer. No evaporation effects due to agricultural irrigation were detected. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Dry deposition of SRP represented 79% of total SRP inputs and it showed a seasonal pattern similar to Saharan dust export to this region, with maxima during spring and summer. Bacterial abundance was significantly correlated with SRP atmospheric deposition, suggesting the influence of this input on bacterioplankton dynamics. The field evidence was experimentally corroborated using bacterial regrowth cultures performed with dust-amended lake water. Dust addition significantly increased SRP concentration in lake water and it stimulated bacterial abundance. Regarding phytoplankton community, only one species, the chrysophyte Chromulina nevadensis, was significantly related to SRP inputs and, consequently, there was a significant decrease in phytoplankton species diversity after atmospheric SRP inputs. Since changes in climate will presumably lead to an alteration in dust export, these results point to the need of further studies on the potential effects of this alteration on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton dynamics in remote oligotrophic systems.									19	0	0	15	0	19			1015-1621			WOS:000254755900001	J	"Alados-Arboledas, L.; Alcantara, A.; Olmo, F.

During the campaign, CIMEL CE-318 robotic radiometer has been one of the key instruments in the characterization of the atmospheric aerosol columnar properties. This kind of radiometers have been operated at Motril, a coastal location at sea level, Pitres (1200 m a.s.l.), located in the South slope of Sierra Nevada Massif, Las Sabinas (2200m a.s.l.), located on the north slope of the mountain range, and Armilla (680m a.s.l.), located in the valley. The principal feature of the locations is that they provide a strong altitudinal gradient. This work presents the evolution of changes followed by the atmospheric aerosol in the vertical column. Columnar aerosol properties have been derived from the CIMEL CE-318 measurements obtained at the four stations. In this sense, the combination of solar direct measurements and sky radiances were used to retrieve the aerosol columnar size distributions by means of Nakajima's code. Marked changes in the atmospheric aerosol along the campaign have been explained in terms of the synoptic conditions. A detailed study of the columnar properties at the different places has been done. Changes in the spectral dependence of the single scattering albedo under the influence of different air masses have been discussed. The size distributions have been fitted to a bimodal lognormal distribution function model, and the associated parameters have been correlated with aerosol optical depth or Angstrom exponent. In some cases, it has been necessary to develop different correlations for cases affected or non-affected by the arrival of Saharan dust. In the case of Armilla (680 m a.s.l.) and Las Sabinas (2200 m a.s.l.), the small horizontal distance allow us to consider that both stations are representative of the same atmospheric column, a fact that has been used to analyse the daily evolution of the mixing layer in the north slope.

However, two early records (Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Ancares) remain uncertain since the corresponding herbarium material has not been found. We also provide details of two new localities of Orthotrichum patens in Romania and two in Turkey, where the species has been poorly recorded.

Indices used include: stream length-gradient index (SL), drainage basin asymmetry (At), hypsometric integral (Hi), ratio of valley-floor width to valley height (Vf), index of drainage basin shape (Bs), and index of mountain front sinuosity (Smf). Results from the analysis are accumulated and expressed as an index of relative active tectonics (Iat), which we divide into four classes from relatively low to highest tectonic activity.The study area along the southwest border of the Sierra Nevada in southern Spain is an ideal location to test the concept of an index to predict relative tectonic activity on a basis of area rather than a single valley or mountain front. The study area has variable rates of active tectonics resulting from the collision of Africa with Europe that has produced linear east-west anticlinal forms, as well as extension with variable vertical rates of normal faulting to about 0.5 m/ky. We test the hypothesis that areas of known, relatively high rates of active tectonics are associated with indicatives values of Iat. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE				19	2			161	172		10.3170/2007-8-18347			Apr-08	2008	Question: Positive interactions are predicted to be common in communities developing under high physical stress or high herbivory pressure due to neighbour amelioration of limiting physical and consumer stresses, respectively. However, when both stress sources meet in the same community, the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms is poorly understood. We ask: What is the relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic mechanisms of facilitation of tree saplings by shrubs in Mediterranean mountain forests?Location: Sierra Nevada, SE Spain (1800-1850 m a.s.l.)Methods: Saplings of four tree taxa ( Acer opalus ssp. granatense, Quercus ilex, Pinus nigra ssp. salzmanii and P. sylvestris var. nevadensis) were planted following a 2 x 2 factorial design: two levels of herbivory ( control and ungulate exclusion) and two microhabitats ( under shrubs and in open areas). Sapling survival and growth were monitored for five years.Results: Shrubs had positive effects on sapling survival both in control and ungulate excluded plots. This effect was species-specific, with shrubs increasing the survival of Acer opalus and Quercus ilex three and twofold, respectively, but having a minor effect on the Pinus species. Herbivory damage was also species-specific, being much higher for Acer opalus than for any other species. Shrubs did not protect saplings of any species against ungulates. Thus, all Acer saplings ( the most damaged species) suffered herbivory outside the exclosures, which largely reduced sapling height.Conclusions: Protection from abiotic stress ( summer drought and winter frost) was much more relevant than protection from biotic stress ( herbivory). However, we propose that the final balance between the two mechanisms can be expected to vary strongly between sites, depending on the relative magnitude of the different sources of stress and the intrinsic traits ( e. g. palatability) of the species interacting.									53	0	1	48	1	55			1100-9233			WOS:000253120500002	J	"Verbisck-Bucker, G.; Gonzalez-Candela, M.; Galian, J.; Cubero-Pablo, M.

We collected conjunctival and ear-canal swabs from 411 free-ranging ibexes. The frequency of infected ibexes was 11.2%. The peak frequency of infection occurred in 1998 and in summer. Granada was the province with greatest risk (odds ratio = 2.6) of carriers (18.8% infected). The predisposing factors were sex (females), age (young animals), and metapopulation (Sierra Nevada). We identified a higher number of infected ibexes in the metapopulation ""Sierra Nevada"" (34/256) and significant differences among the three established metapopulations (P<0.01).

Moreover, some of these plants are the economic income for local farmers. Particularly in SE Spain, soil erosion is a core factor in environmental degradation attributed primarily to the cultivation practices and human pressure on the land. Over a four-year period, soil erosion and runoff were monitored in erosion plots on a mountainside, comparing four harvest intensities of four aromatic shrubs (Lavandula lanata L., Santolina rosmarinifolia L. Origanum bastetanum, and Salvia lavandulifolia V.): 0% (HI-0), 25% (HI-25), 50% (HI-50), and 75% (HI-75). Also, the fresh biomass and essential-oil content were quantified in each treatment. The erosion plots were located in Lanjaron (Granada, SE Spain) on the southern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, on a 20% slope, and of 96 in 2 in area. The average soil loss for HI-0, HI-25, HI-50, and HI-75 during the study period was 144.6, 187.2, 256.0, and 356.0 kg ha(-1) respectively, and runoff 2.6, 3.2, 3.4, and 4,7 mm, respectively. The lowest average soil erosion and runoff rates for the study period were recorded with plant cover of S. lavandulifolia V. 67.6 kg ha(-1) and 1.3 mm, respectively. Since no significant differences were found between HI-25 and HI-50 for soil erosion and runoff, and harvest and distillation of wild-aromatic plants currently persists as an important economic activity in mountainous areas of the study zone, we recommend a rational harvest (HI-50), leaving the 50% of the plant biomass in the field (especially for sage and lavender) to avoid the soil degradation. In this sense, the harvest of 50% of fresh herb of sage, santolina, lavender, and oregano produced reasonable essential-oil yield of 12.7, 14.0, 19.7, and 18.3 L ha(-1), respectively. The inappropriate harvest of aromatic plants and the intensity fanning systems of mountain areas endanger land conservation, and there is an Urgent need to implement appropriate land management which has a large-scale perspective but acts at the local level.

We experimentally followed the fates of 3,200 marked and weighed acorns from dispersal through the time of seedling emergence over three years. Rodents handled about 99% of acorns, and dispersed 67% and cached 7.4% of the dispersed acorns. Most caches were recovered and consumed, and only 1.3% of the original experimental acorns were found alive in caches the following spring. Dispersal distances were short (mean = 356.2 cm, median = 157 cm) and strongly right-skewed. Heavier acorns were dispersed further and were more likely to be cached and survive than lighter acorns. All caches were in litter or soil, and each contained a single acorn. Rodents moved acorns nonrandomly, mostly to oaks and pines. Most surviving acorns were either in oaks, a poor microhabitat for oak recruitment, or shrubs, a suitable microhabitat for oak recruitment. Our results suggest that rodents, by burying a relatively high proportion of acorns singly in shrubs and pines, act as moderately effective dispersers of Q. ilex. Nonetheless, this dispersal comes at a very heavy cost.									86	12	0	83	1	97			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000254238500012	18075760J	"Alasaad, S.; Granados, J. E.; Cano-Manuel, F.

The prevalence reached 0.53% by necropsy and 1.87% by faecal examination. Taking into account both diagnostic methodologies and the total number of animals affected (n = 14), we obtained a yearly prevalence of 0.7 +/- 0.3%. The infection with F. hepatica was found not to be related to host sex, climatology or to co-infection with Sarcoptes scabiei (the most important parasite affecting Iberian ibex, with a prevalence of 49.27 +/- 7.90% in the examined animals). The prevalence of fasciolosis decreased significantly during the period under study and this would be explained by an increase of ibex resistance to this fluke as a result of a reduction of the parasite abundance in the area and/or a reduction of the host infection rate. There was no statistical difference between the two diagnostic methods for the examination of fasciolosis during the period in which both methods were used. Therefore, examination of faecal samples as a non-invasive procedure may provide a useful approach for monitoring fasciolosis in wild ungulate populations. The results of the present study provided foundation for the effective control of F. hepatica infection in Iberian ibex.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0932-0113			WOS:000253522900027	18092179J	"Batlles, F.

A detailed spatial and temporal analysis of global solar radiation on the earth surface is needed in many applications, ranging from solar energy uses to the study of agricultural, forest and biological processes. At local scales, the topography is the most important factor in the distribution of solar radiation on the surface. The variability of the elevation, the surface orientation and the obstructions due to elevations are a source of great local differences in insolation and, consequently, in other variables as ground temperature. For this reason, several models based on GIS techniques have been recently developed, integrating topography to obtain the solar radiation on the surface.In this work, global radiation is analyzed with the Solar Analyst, a model implemented on ArcView, that computes the topographic parameters: altitude, latitude, slope and orientation (azimuth) and shadow effects. Solar Analyst uses as input parameters the diffuse fraction and the transmittance. These parameters are not usually available in radiometric networks in mountainous areas. In this work, a method to obtain both parameters from global radiation is proposed. Global radiation data obtained in two networks of radiometric stations is used: one located in Sierra Magina Natural Park (Spain) with 11 stations and another one located on the surroundings of Sierra Nevada Natural Park (Spain) with 14 stations. Daily solar irradiation is calculated from a digital terrain model (DTM), the daily diffuse fraction, K, and daily atmospheric transmittivity, tau. Results provided by the model have been compared with measured values. An overestimation for high elevations is observed, whereas low altitudes present underestimation. The best performance was also reported during summer months, and the worst results were obtained during winter. Finally, a yearly global solar irradiation map has been produced for the studied zone.

Many non-exclusive factors have been proposed to explain these altitudinal patterns, including climate habitat structure, productivity, geographical factors, and historical factors. In this study, we investigated the altitudinal trend of beetle richness and diversity. trying to determine the factors affecting beetle diversity and composition along an altitudinal gradient on a high mountain of the Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain), Beetles were sampled every 15 d for 2 y using pitfall traps at 10 altitudinal sites located between 2000 and 3000 m asl. Against predictions, beetle diversity and the standardized richness indices were not correlated with altitude. Insteads, lower richness and diversity values were found at middle altitude in the selected altitudinal range. Although a combination of biotic and abiotic factors satisfactorily explained these richness and diversity values, the main factor was plant diversity, which was correlated with all richness and diversity indices. A second factor was temperature; however, the interaction between beetle richness and temperature was evident only when the effect of plant diversity was removed. Multivariate analysis for species composition showed that 2 factors, plant diversity and shrill) cover, explained more than 50% of the variance observed. In summary, our results suggest a strong dependence of beetle on vegetation structure and diversity. although temperature appears to be a complementary factor determining beetle richness and diversity in the high mountains of the Serra Nevada National Park."									9	0	0	7	0	9			1195-6860			WOS:000261940600003	S	"Paegelow, M.; Camacho, Olmedo M.

A wide range of new methodological approaches in geomatics -such as neural networks, multi-agent systems or fuzzy logics- have been developed. Despite this progress, the modelling softwares available have to be considered as experimental tools rather than improved procedures that are able to work for environmental management or decision support. In particular, the authors think that a large number of publications suffer from discrepancies, when trying to validate their model's results.This contribution describes three different modelling approaches applied to prospective land cover prediction. The first one, a combined geomatic method, uses Markov chains for temporal transition prediction, while their spatial assignment is supervised manually by the construction of suitability maps. Compared to this directed method, the two others may be considered as semi-automatic because both the polychotomous regression and the multilayer perceptron only need to be optimized during a training step the algorithms themselves detect the spatial-temporal changes in land cover.The authors describe the three methodological approaches and their practical applications to two mountainous studied areas: one in the French Pyrenees, the second including a large part of Sierra Nevada, Spain. The article focuses on the comparison of results. The major result is that prediction scores are higher than the actual land cover is persistent. They also underline that the geomatic model is complementary to the statistical ones which perform higher overall prediction rates but produce weaker simulations when there are numerous land cover changes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1863-5520(print)		978-3-540-68489-3(H)	BCI:BCI200900118540	J	de Galdeano, C.

Consequently, the direction of the extension is close to that occurred at the South of Sierra Nevada and the characteristics of the paleostress ellipsoid are congruent with this uplift. On the other hand, two local controls have been observed in the development of the minor fractures: there is a clear lithologic influence, particularly in the contact between levels of silts and other formed by coarser sediments. Moreover, local changes of the stress produced a different grade of the fracturation.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0367-0449			WOS:000261862700002	J	"Pascual, Emilio; Donaire, Teodosio; Pin, Christian"				Donaire, Teodosio/P-7032-2014	Donaire, Teodosio/0000-0001-5582-2253			The significance of microgranular enclaves in assessing the magmatic evolution of a high-level composite batholith: A case on the Los Pedroches Batholith, Iberian Massif, Spain								GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				42	2			177	198					2008	2008	To evaluate the origin and significance of microgranular enclaves hosted by granites, we present new data on two granitoid series belonging to the Los Pedroches Batholith (LPB), SW Iberian Massif, Spain. The two series in the LPB show a distinct contrast in terms of field, petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data. This contrast also extends to the enclaves, differing in abundance and other features in each of the series considered. Isotopic measurements, however, including Sr-87/Sr-86, Eld and delta O-18 data, show no significant, inter- or intra-series contrast throughout the LPB. These data lend additional support to an origin of all the granitoid rocks in the LPB from a single, isotopically homogeneous, lower crustal source. We also suggest that differences between microgranular enclaves in the two LPB granitoid series cannot be related to a different degree of participation of mafic rocks in the genesis of the respective groups: in both cases, microgranular enclaves are better interpreted as autoliths.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0016-7002	1880-5973		WOS:000261047500004	S	"Bullejos, F.

The initial one, in 1996, corresponded to the reflooding of the basin after a severe drought and was composed mainly of the colonising species Fragilaria rumpens, together with a lesser presence of Nitzschia sublincaris and Hantzschia amphioxys. The predominant presence of F. rumpens at the end of the summer of 2006 coincided with low species diversity (values of Shannon and Wiener Index: 0.3-0.6). During the following two years another assemblage established itself dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, which is considered to be more stable and widespread among the lakes of the Sierra Nevada. The most notable subdominant species (less than 20% of relative abundance) in this assemblage were: Encyonema minutum, Encyonopsis microcephala and Navicula cryptocephala. The diversity values during this second period were much higher than in the first: 1.0-2.2. Nutrient concentrations were measured separately in the linnetic (epilimnetic) and benthic (epilithic) environments. These abiotic parameters show that the dynamics of ammonia and silica were much the same in both, showing a gradual decrease from the beginning to the end of the study period. Epilimnetic phosphorus followed a similar pattern to ammonia and silica. In the epilithon, nitrates and phosphates increased during the first year, only to descend notably during the second. The effect of other environmental parameters such as temperature and the preceding drought on the dynamics of the diatom assemblage are discussed. Ratio DIN:SRP let its test the different degrees of phosphorus limitation in epilithon and epilimnion environments; our results suggest that phosphorus limitation of primary production in high mountain lakes is much more severe in the limnetic environment that it is in the epilithon."									3	1	0	3	0	4			1129-5767			WOS:000258476000006	J	"Grayson, Donald K.; Millar, Constance I."								Prehistoiric human influence on the abundance and distiribution of deadwood in alpine landscapes								PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS				10	2			101	108		10.1016/j.ppees.2008.01.002			2008	2008	Scientists have long inferred the locations of past treelines from the distribution of deadwood above modern tree boundaries. Although it is recognized that deadwood above treeline may have decayed, the absence of such wood is routinely taken to imply the absence of trees for periods ranging from the past few millennia to the entire Holocene. Reconstructed treeline histories are then explained in terms of such variables as slope, drainage, temperature, solar insolation, and precipitation. While these variables certainly help determine where deadwood is to be found above treeline today, we suggest that they cannot always explain where it is not to be found. In the alpine environments of the western United States, archeological work has established a human presence during nearly the entire Holocene in portions of the Rocky Mountains and for over 5000 radiocarbon years in the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada. We suggest that prehistoric occupations may have stripped deadwood from the landscape in all of these areas. To the extent that this is true, reconstructions of past treelines from deadwood may reflect the human prehistory of an area as much as it reflects treeline history itself. We encourage evaluation of this hypothesis in areas of active dendrochronological and archeological research. (c) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Alternatively, long-distance dispersal might explain the extant distribution pattern of mountain species in this region.Aims: Here, we report an investigation of two alpine plants, Saxifraga oppositifolia and S. stellaris, which co-occur in the Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees, and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. Our aim was to distinguish between (successive) vicariance and long-distance dispersal as alternative explanations for their present-day geographical distribution across these high mountain ranges. The patterns found in these two species were compared to those of four other mountain species previously studied by us.Methods: Samples of 378 individuals from 21 populations were surveyed for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) variation.Results: We found that vicariance best explains the phylogeographic pattern of S. oppositifolia, while in S. stellaris, Sierra Nevada samples fell within the group of non-monophyletic Pyrenean populations. Together with genetic diversity evidence, this latter pattern is hypothesised to reflect incomplete lineage sorting following range fragmentation rather than long-distance dispersal from the Pyrenees to the Sierra Nevada. Additionally, in S. stellaris, a distinct genetic cluster from the Massif Central was observed. Levels of among-region and among-population differentiation were higher in S. stellaris than in S. oppositifolia. This may be taken as evidence of a more strongly disrupted glacial distribution of the former species, and also accords with its preference for more specialised and patchily distributed habitats when compared to those of the 'pioneering' S. oppositifolia.Conclusions: In conjunction with our previous investigation, we conclude that vicariance is the predominant, but not sole process shaping the genetic architecture of south-west European high mountain disjuncts. Furthermore, 'successive vicariance' was only observed in three previously studied species but not in the two Saxifrages analysed here, possibly due to the persistence of past patterns of population substructuring.									26	0	0	26	0	26			1755-0874			WOS:000262132600009	S	"Rolland, A.; Lopez de Coca, P.; Costa, V.; Rodriguez, E.; Olivares, I."

LEHMANN (2004) raised Tetrix bipunctata kraussi (Saulcy) to species distinct from T. bipunctata (L.); this option is consolidated a posteriori by the sympatry of both taxa, known in several localities. 2-la. The name Monopterus Fischer von Waldheim, 1846, whom the European species Gryllus frigidus Boheman, 1846, pertains, is a more recent homonym, and thus not valid, of Monopterus Lacepede, 1800 (Poisson SYNBRANCHIDAE); 2-lb. Recent genetic studies show that Gryllus frigidus Boheman must be put in the Nearctic genus Melanoplus Stal (with which Bohemanella be-comes synonymous, then); 2-2. Two specific epithets referring to the same species, Gryllus frigidus Boheman, and Monopterus gracilis Fischer von Waldheim, were created on the same year (1846); the first one is used more, and for this reason it must to be preserved, waiting for a decision from the Commission. 3. The name LOCUSTINAE Kirby, 1825, is prioritary over the younger synonymous name OEDIPODINAE Walker, 1870. 4. The name Psophus Fieber 1853 (not 1852!) is not identical to the name Psopha Fieber 1852; it is thus valid. 5. The family-group name PARAPLEURINI Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1893, is available because it is built on the genus name Parapleurus Fischer, 1853; MECOSTHETINI HEBARD, 1924, VICHET1NI HARZ, 1975, and CERACRINI YIN, 1984, are younger synonyms. 6. The genus-group name Euthystira, created by Fieber in 1853, is often used at the subgenus level; however, the conformation of its ovipositor can to apologise to keep it at the genus level. 7. Stenobothrus stigmaticus (Rambur, 1838) is missing today in the type locality (Nevada Sierra, Spain), and the type is lost; then, one can think that this name refers in fact to Omocestus panteli (Bolivar, 1887); it is thus necessary to ask for the Commission to maintain the current spelling. 8. The name Crotalacris Chopard, 1952, seems to be no more than a younger synonym, and thus invalidate, of the name Stenobothrodes Tarbinsky, 1848. 9. No old specific epithet being available to validly refer to Gryllus miniatus Charpentier (= Stenobothrus rubicundus auctores, not Goeze, 1778, nec Germar, 1817), it was necessary to forge an entirely new name: it was rubicundulus, created by KRUSEMAN & JEEKEL (1967b). 10. It is necessary to ask the Commission to solve contradiction between Article 16.2 of the I.C.Z.N. (which requires, for the creation of a name of family group, to fix the type genus, with name of author and date), and the Recommendation 16.B (which only ""advises"" it). 11. To know by which subspecies Aeropedellus variegatus (Fischer von Waldheim) is represented in the French Alps, it will be necessary initially to designate a neotype for the nominate subspecies, and to specify its morphological characteristics."									0	0		0	0	0			1764-6308			ZOOREC:ZOOR14409050791	J	"Lorite, Juan; Gomez, Francisco; Francisco Mota, Juan; Valle, Francisco"				"Lorite, Juan/F-4690-2011; Mota, Juan/M-2254-2014"	"Lorite, Juan/0000-0003-4617-8069; Mota, Juan/0000-0001-5754-279X"			Orophilous plant communities of Baetic range in Andalusia (south-eastern Spain): priority altitudinal-islands for conservation								PHYTOCOENOLOGIA				37	03-Apr			625	644		10.1127/0340-269X/2007/0037-0625			DEC 21 2007	2007	"The present work compares several localities in the high-mountain of the Baetic Cordilleras on the basis of plant communities, to establish priorities for conservation.

The data analysis of presence/ absence in the different massifs resulted in 4 groups: the first composed of Teleda-Almijara, calcareous Sierra Nevada, and Gador; the second of Grazalema, las Nieves, Loja, Lujar, Estancias, and Huetor-Harana; the third of Baza, Maria-Orce, Cazorla, the Subbetic, Magina, and la Sagra; the fourth of Filabres and siliceous Sierra Nevada. The CATPCA quite clearly separated the groups with well-differentiated conservation needs on the basis of their ecology and degree conservation (this being a combination of different factors). Finally, the work concludes by discussing the results and making a series of recommendations for conservation at community level."									7	0	0	7	0	7			0340-269X			WOS:000251957000014	J	"Perez-Garcia, Francisco Javier; Cueto, Miguel; Penas, Julio; Martinez-Hernandez, Fabian; Medina-Cazorla, Jose Miguel; Garrido-Becerra, Juan Antonio; Mota, Juan Francisco"				"Martinez-Hernandez, Fabian/I-9058-2014; Perez-Gacia, Francisco/N-7557-2014; Penas, Julio/N-4885-2014; Mota, Juan/M-2254-2014; Garrido-Becerra, Juan Antonio/A-2236-2015"	"Cueto Romero, Miguel/0000-0001-7398-9591; Martinez-Hernandez, Fabian/0000-0002-5124-5492; Perez-Gacia, Francisco/0000-0002-5778-2803; Penas, Julio/0000-0001-6102-4610; Mota, Juan/0000-0001-5754-279X; Garrido-Becerra, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-1141-7288"			Selection of an endemic flora reserve network and its biogeographical significance in the Baetic ranges (Southern Spain)								ACTA BOTANICA GALLICA				154	4			545	571					Dec-07	2007	The Baetic mountains are a very important centre of plant diversity and endemicity. The current environmental legislation includes many of these localities. In order to assess the current reserves network and to propose a selection of protected areas, and to examine the biogeographic distinctiveness of that selection, we applied to the orophilous endemic flora a variety of algorithms (some of which were never used for Europe before) on the Baetic ranges. In order to preserve this natural heritage, it would be necessary to protect at least twelve massifs, considering the siliceous portion of Sierra Nevada as a great priority area. The most notable gaps in the legislation are the ranges of Gador, Revolcadores and La Pandera. The selected localities were characterized by their great biogeographical distinctiveness. The distinctiveness of the obtained selections stresses their reliability and also emphasizes the suitability of the biogeographic researches of the flora of the Baetic ranges for conservation objectives.									5	0	0	6	0	6			1253-8078			WOS:000252596700006	J	Tinaut, Alberto								First record of the genus Amblyopone Erichson, 1842 (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) in Sierra Nevada (Granada) and Oriental Andalusia.

Daphnia appears to colonize this lake every spring by hatching from ephippia and reproduce by means of subitaneous (non-diapausing) and ephippial (diapausing) eggs. D. pulicaria in this lake is an obligate parthenogenetic population. There is a short time period for subitaneous egg production and a much longer period for ephippial egg production. The contribution of subitaneous eggs to Daphnia population density and structure appears to be low. Diapause onset showed a high temporal synchronization in the three studied years in Rio Seco Lake, and day-length emerged as the main cue triggering diapause onset and the main explanatory factor for the proportion of ephippial females observed. The development and reproduction of D. pulicaria in Rio Seco Lake involves taking a gamble on resting forms to guarantee inter-annual Daphnia persistence in the lake, giving priority to investment in future generations.					7th International Symposium on Cladocera7th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 03-09, 2005SEP 03-09, 2005		Herzberg, SWITZERLANDHerzberg, SWITZERLAND	5	0	0	5	0	5			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000250407500008	J	"Aranda, V.; Oyonarte, C."								Characterization of the organic matter of soil surface horizons in selected Mediterranean environments using IR spectroscopy								AGROCHIMICA				51	6			269	284					NOV-DEC 2007	2007	The study of the organic matter is essential in areas with high degradation risks like the Mediterranean climate environments. The aim of this work is to establish the effect of the parent material, climate conditions and vegetation type on the evolution of the soil organic matter in different Mediterranean environments as an essential step for assessing soil stability and indirectly the fragility of these ecosystems that are prone to erosion.Thirty-six soil samples of organic-mineral horizon were taken in unreclaimed soils from areas of great ecological value in South-East Spain with calcareous (Sierra de Cazorla-Segura-Las Villas Natural Park), acid metamorphic (Sierra Nevada National Park) and calcareous and volcanic substrata (Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park), and beneath three vegetation types (natural forests, reforested forests and scrublands).Characterization of the soil organic fraction by IR spectroscopy showed relatively uniform results probably caused by similar climatic and Mediterranean environmental conditions. Nonetheless, humic substances in the surface horizons were better developed in the calcareous/volcanic area than the calcareous and acid metamorphic areas, with the latter showing the greatest differences. The acid environment soils of Sierra Nevada can be characterized as the least favourable for efficient humus development, with it then being more fragile in terms of conservation. The results also indicate some differences due to the type of vegetation on soil humus chemistry, with a more negative effect beneath reforested forests of Pinus in an edaphic acid environment. In general, it may be stated that the organic matter beneath scrubland and natural forests of Quercus are more decomposed than beneath Pinus and the humus is more evolved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-1857			WOS:000254262100001	J	"Acevedo, Pelayo; Cassinello, Jorge; Gortazar, Christian"				"Gortazar, Christian/E-7918-2012; Acevedo, Pelayo/L-6737-2013; Cassinello, Jorge/A-4324-2009"	"Gortazar, Christian/0000-0003-0012-4006; Acevedo, Pelayo/0000-0002-3509-7696; "			The Iberian ibex is under an expansion trend but displaced to suboptimal habitats by the presence of extensive goat livestock in central Spain								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				16	12			3361	3376		10.1007/s10531-006-9032-y			Nov-07	2007	In this paper an updated distribution of the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica, Schinz 1838) in the central Spanish region of Castile-La Mancha is shown. The species is present in 19% of the study region, and in areas not cited so far in the literature. A detailed analysis of habitat suitability was also carried out, applying a new methodology, Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis, which uses presence data to build a habitat suitability map of a given species. As livestock activity is quite intense in the region, the presence of a potential competitor, the domestic goat (Capra hircus), was included in the analyses. Factors affecting ibex relative abundance were determined by means of a nested stepwise multiple regression, where livestock presence/absence was the nested factor. The presence of livestock has a negative effect on ibex relative abundance, causing the ibex to select areas of poor, sparse vegetation, cultivated lands and forests, whereas in the absence of livestock, the ibex is mainly present in pasture-scrub lands and non-cultivated lands. Conservation implications of these results are discussed in the context of a Mediterranean region where extensive livestock grazing systems abound.									18	0	0	18	0	20			0960-3115			WOS:000249805300009	J	"de Sanjose-Blasco, Jose Juan; Atkinson-Gordo, Alan D.

Its formation is recent and it is associated with the process of the deglaciation that the Corral del Veleta underwent at the end of the Little Ice Age. The rock glacier was formed from an accumulation of heavy boulders in a permafrost environment. At present, the rock glacier shows activity. In order to calculate the annual movement, 14 rods were initially placed on its surface in the year 2001. The dynamic monitoring of the rods was carried out using two geomatics methods: 1) a geodetic survey using a total station, and 2) the application of a precise global positioning system (GPS). The results have shown generalized activity over the entire rock glacier, although sites showing vertical displacement (sinking) predominated over those showing horizontal displacement (advance). For the mapping of the entire rock glacier, close range photogrammetry was used.					6th International Conference on Geomorphology6th International Conference on Geomorphology	SEP 06-11, 2005SEP 06-11, 2005		Zaragoza, SPAINZaragoza, SPAIN	3	0	0	0	0	3			0372-8854			WOS:000252082900006	J	"Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio; Rivas, Jose M."

The present work examines the way in which dipper (Cinclus cinclus) morphology has varied over the past 20 years (1985-2005) in Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). Tarsus length has decreased, but wing and tail length have increased in the same period. These opposite trends have provoked changes in the allometric relationships among the different parts of the body in the dipper. A decrease in body size is predicted by Bergmann's rule, and similar results have been found in other birds. However, although this study found a decrease in tarsus length, no change was found for body mass. The increase in wing and tail length may be related to a variation in the trophic niche in response to the decrease in water volume of rivers that occurred during the study period. Other studies show that the dipper's diet varies with water flow, and water flow has decreased in the study area as a consequence of climatic warming.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0021-8375			WOS:000249730900013	J	"Reinhardt, L.

In the 27 km 2 Ri o Torrente catchment, Sierra Nevada, southern Spain, rapid base- level fall has triggered knickpoint migration up both trunk and tributary channels, resulting in two distinct geomorphic zones: ( 1) a steep lower catchment with concordant rates of hillslope erosion and channel incision over both short ( 100 years: 5 - 8 mm yr(-1)) and medium ( 12 ka: 5 +/- 1 mm yr(-1)) timescales and ( 2) a low- relief soil- mantled upland topography with uniformly low bedrock and hillslope erosion rates ( 0.05 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1)). The uniformity of erosion in this upland surface indicates that catchment topography was previously in steady state. Rapid river incision below the channel knickpoints has resulted in the development of steep landslide-dominated hillslopes that are essentially "" tracking'' the incising channel. The magnitude of base- level fall required to generate these steep hillslopes is > 100 m; at least 50 m of this base- level fall occurred during the past similar to 21 ka. These steep hillslopes are eroding back into the low- angled upland surface at a much slower rate than the channel knickpoint. Consequently, the trunk channel knickpoint has already reached the catchment headwaters while hillslopes continue to adjust to the new base level, indicating that the channel profile will regain equilibrium form long before hillslopes. Thus hillslopes are the limiting factor for the duration of landscape transience in this small mountain catchment."									27	0	0	0	1	27			0148-0227			WOS:000249852900001	J	"Acevedo, Pelayo; Cassinello, Jorge; Hortal, Joaquin; Gortazar, Christian"				"Gortazar, Christian/E-7918-2012; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; Acevedo, Pelayo/L-6737-2013; Evolutionary Ecology, Ecologia Evolutiva/M-3553-2014; Cassinello, Jorge/A-4324-2009; Hortal, Joaquin/A-1531-2008"	"Gortazar, Christian/0000-0003-0012-4006; Acevedo, Pelayo/0000-0002-3509-7696; Hortal, Joaquin/0000-0002-8370-8877"			Invasive exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) as a major threat to native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica): a habitat suitability model approach								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				13	5			587	597		10.1111/j,1472-4642.2007.00374.x			Sep-07	2007	The introduction of alien species to new environments is one of the main threats to the conservation of biodiversity. One particularly problematic example is that of wild ungulates which are increasingly being established in regions outside their natural distribution range due to human hunting interests. Unfortunately, we know little of the effects these large herbivores may have on the host ecosystems. This study deals with a first comparative analysis of the habitat requirements of two ungulate species that may be facing competition for resources in the south of Europe: the native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) and the exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). The aoudad is a North African caprid introduced in 1970 as a game species in south-eastern Spain. It has adapted well, and populations have been freely expanding since then. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis is used to describe the realized niche of both species where their distribution ranges merge. Both species occupy marginal areas of rugged terrain in the region. Marginality is higher for the Iberian ibex, which also presents a higher tolerance of secondary environmental gradients than the aoudad. Highly suitable areas for each species are secondarily suitable for the other. Reclassified and cross-tabulated habitat suitability maps showing the areas of potential spatial coexistence and differences in ecological traits between both species are provided. The results obtained do not allow inferring resource competition between these species. However, current aoudad expansion could result in it invading the favoured habitats of the ibex. Inadequate hunting policy and monitoring, and increasing climatic resemblance of the study region to the native aoudad areas, due to a strong desertification process, are facilitating a high rate of expansion. We strongly recommend to eradicate or, at least, monitor these exotic populations, and promote active conservation practices, if one wants to preserve the unique natural resources present in this European region.									23	1	0	20	1	25			1366-9516			WOS:000248967400012	J	"Gomez, Jose M.; Bosch, Jordi; Perfectti, Francisco; Fernandez, Juande; Abdelaziz, Mohamed"				"Perfectti, Francisco/C-5087-2008; "	"Perfectti, Francisco/0000-0002-5551-213X; Abdelaziz Mohamed, Mohamed/0000-0003-0533-6817"			Pollinator diversity affects plant reproduction and recruitment: the tradeoffs of generalization								OECOLOGIA				153	3			597	605		10.1007/s00442-007-0758-3			Sep-07	2007	One outstanding and unsolved challenge in ecology and conservation biology is to understand how pollinator diversity affects plant performance. Here, we provide evidence of the functional role of pollination diversity in a plant species, Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). Pollinator abundance, richness and diversity as well as plant reproduction and recruitment were determined in eight plant populations. We found that E. mediohispanicum was generalized both at the regional and local (population) scale, since its flowers were visited by more than 100 species of insects with very different morphology, size and behaviour. However, populations differed in the degree of generalization. Generalization correlated with pollinator abundance and plant population size, but not with habitat, ungulate damage intensity, altitude or spatial location. More importantly, the degree of generalization had significant consequences for plant reproduction and recruitment. Plants from populations with intermediate generalization produced more seeds than plants from populations with low or high degrees of generalization. These differences were not the result of differences in number of flowers produced per plant. In addition, seedling emergence in a common garden was highest in plants from populations with intermediate degree of generalization. This outcome suggests the existence of an optimal level of generalizations even for generalized plant species.									48	2	0	50	1	52			0029-8549			WOS:000248812000011	17576602J	"Delgado, R.; Sanchez-Maranon, M.; Martin-Garcia, J.

When compared with unaffected reference soils, those of ski runs had substantial loss of organic carbon (-34%, -11.9 +/- 3.6 t ha(-1)) and micropore volume and size (-33%, -0.07 +/- 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3) and -48%, -1.62 +/- 0.28 mu m). Microstructure showed a dramatic reduction in organic cements and fungal hyphae. The organic content of soil seeded with grass significantly improved compared with soil not seeded or seeded unsuccessfully (P < 0.05), especially where the topsoil was reinstated. Organic C content, microporosity and soil respiration increased by 200% (+21 +/- 5 t ha(-1)), 70% (+0.07 +/- 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)) and 140% (+0.10 +/- 0.04 mg CO2 g(-1) day(-1)), respectively. Average micropore size in aggregates which in undisturbed soils was 3.40 +/- 0.28 mu m reverted to 3.52 +/- 0.36 mu m. However, the microstructure of the revegetated soils did not attain the levels of organic cements and fungal hyphae in the natural soils. Dolomite and salts were added to the soil to aid slope stabilization, fertility and de-icing of access tracks. As a consequence, there were increases in pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate equivalent and base saturation. The influence of management on soil properties was found to be greater than that of environmental factors.									24	0	0	22	1	24			0266-0032			WOS:000249420400007	J	Gil-T., Felipe								The correct hostplant of Polyommatus golgus (Hubner, 1813): Anthyllis vulneraria pseudoarundana H.

In an attempt to offset this lack of data, the present study provides information on different biochemical properties of soils from Sierra Nevada and Sierra Maria (southern Spain), covering a range of altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 m. In general, the values of the properties analyzed were similar to those of other mountain soils, although the values of basal respiration were particularly low, possibly due to the low levels of humidity at the time of sampling. The biochemical properties were closely correlated with each other, as observed in soils from other type of environments. Altitude had a clear effect on the biochemical properties because of its effect on climate and vegetation. At both sites, the soil samples showing the most homogenous pattern of biochemical properties (seen through star diagrams) were those corresponding to intermediate altitudes.									12	0	0	12	1	13			0178-2762			WOS:000247999500011	J	"Guerra, J.; Cano, M.

The evolution of this complex can help to determine both when the lower HP/LT complexes began to exhume and the behavior of the upper plate during this process. Moreover, this complex is a key element to understanding the relationships between the late orogenic extension in the internal Betic Cordillera and the coeval compression in the External Zones of the same mountain chain. This paper focuses in the geometry and kinematics of the Alpine structures of this Malaguide Complex in the eastern Betic Cordillera, near the village of Velez Rubio. We propose that these Alpine structures can be grouped into three main stages. First stage (Paleogene) began with a synmetamorphic slaty cleavage produced in anchizone conditions. This foliation is associated with northward vergent structures and was probably connected with the superposition of the Malaguide Complex over the Alpujarride during the middle Eocene. This first stage ended with the thinning of the Malaguide Complex (Oligocene) by an extensional detachment with a top-to-the-NNW sense of movement. Second stage records the convergence of the External and Internal Zones during the Aquitanian-Burdigalian. This convergence was a right-lateral transpression that produced back thrusts and extensional structures that exhumed the HP/LT rocks of the Alpujarride Complex. Third stage corresponds to the evolution from the late Burdigalian to the present-day, when the Internal and External zones were welded together.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0278-7407			WOS:000248427600001	J	"Linares-Cuesta, J.

As in other Microtus species analyzed, C. nivalis Msat-160 is AT rich, has a monomer length of 160 bp, is undermethylated and is mainly located in all the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome, but is completely absent from the Y chromosome. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that Msat-160 was initially distributed in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome. The taxonomic status of the genus Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus is a very interesting issue, so we constructed phylogenetic dendrograms using Msat-160 sequences from several Microtus species. Although the results were not informative about this issue, the presence of Msat-160 in C. nivalis and Microtus species suggested that both genera are closely related and that this satellite DNA was present in the common ancestor. Studies of Msat-160 in different arvicoline species could help to determine the origin of this satellite and, perhaps, to establish the phylogenetic relationships of some arvicoline groups.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0016-6707	1573-6857		WOS:000245429300005	16897458J	"Meyer, Marc D.; North, Malcolm P.; Gray, Andrew N.; Zald, Harold S.

Influence of soil thickness on stand characteristics in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest								PLANT AND SOIL				294	01-Feb			113	123		10.1007/s11104-007-9235-3			May-07	2007	Soil thickness can be an important factor influencing vegetation, yet few spatially-explicit studies have examined soil horizon thickness and vegetation composition in summer-drought forests. We compared seismic and soil penetration measurements of combined A + C and Cr horizon thickness, soil moisture and temperature, and stand variables in a contiguous 4-ha mixed-conifer stand of the Sierra Nevada. Thickness of A + C and Cr horizons were highly variable but were not correlated to each other. Total basal area and canopy cover were positively related with A + C horizon thickness, and shrub cover was positively related with Cr horizon thickness. Basal area of white fir [Abies concolor (Gord and Glend) Lindl.] and incense-cedar [Calocedrus decurrens (Torrey) Florin] were positively correlated with A + C horizon thickness, but there was no relationship between A + C or Cr horizon thickness and basal area of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. and Balf.), sugar pine (P. lambertiana Douglas), or red fir (A. magnifica A. Murray). Both white and red fir seedlings were associated with decreased soil temperature, but only white fir seedlings were positively associated with soil moisture. Soil penetration estimates of soil thickness were similar to seismic estimates for shallow soils (< 50 cm depth) but were poorly related on deeper soils. Visual surface conditions and tile probe estimates of soil thickness can be highly misleading because 'shallow' areas may have a thick layer of weathered bedrock that can serve as a potential rooting medium for deep-rooted trees and shrubs. In our study only the refraction seismic method had the potential to measure total soil depth that included A + C and Cr horizon thickness.									21	2	0	16	1	22			0032-079X			WOS:000246615300010	J	"Reinhardt, L.

Tectonic denudation and topographic development in the Spanish Sierra Nevada								TECTONICS				26	3					TC3001	10.1029/2006TC001954			MAY 1 2007	2007	The denudation history of the rapidly uplifting western part of the Spanish Sierra Nevada was assessed using apatite fission track (AFT) ages and (10)Be analyses of bedrock and fluvial sediments. Major contrasts in the denudation history are recorded within the 27 km(2) Rio Torrente catchment. Upland areas are characterized by low-relief, low slope angles, and locally the preservation of shallow marine sediments, which have experienced <200 m of erosion in the last 9 Myr. However, AFT age determinations from samples collected close to the marine sediments imply >2 km of denudation since circa 4 Ma. The minimum denudation rates of 0.4 mm yr(-1) derived from AFT also contrast with the slow medium-term (10(4) years) erosion rates (0.044 +/- 0.015 mm yr(-1)) estimated from (10)Be measurements at high elevations. The local medium-long-term contrasts in denudation rates within the high Sierra Nevada indicate that much of the unroofing occurs by tectonic denudation on flat-lying detachments. In lower elevation parts of the catchment, rapid river incision coupled to rock uplift has produced similar to 1.6 km of relief, implying that the rivers and adjacent hillslopes close to the edge of the orogen are sensitive to normal-fault-driven changes in base level. However, these changes are not transmitted into the low-relief slowly eroding upland areas. Thus the core of the mountain range continues to increase in elevation until the limits of crustal strength are reached and denudation is initiated along planes of structural weakness. We propose that this form of tectonic denudation provides an effective limit to relief in young orogens.									14	0	0	1	0	14			0278-7407			WOS:000246309100001	J	"Calle, J. A.; Ortiz, A.

La Caldera is used here as a prototypical example of small high-mountain lakes. Our results demonstrate that transport and mixing in small high-mountain lakes are shaped by the severe changes exhibited at diurnal time scales by the heat fluxes through the air-water interface, strong winds of episodic nature (storms), and the limited horizontal and vertical length scale of the basin. The thermal structure during the cooling phase of the ice-free period undergoes episodic changes that occur at short-time scales, driven by the strong winds with speeds of 15 m s(-1) and higher. During those storms, horizontal and vertical mixing and transport is predominantly driven by wind. During inter-storm periods, the oscillatory nature of the air-water heat exchange at diurnal time scales drives convective circulation, which for a small lake occurs at the basin scale and becomes the dominant mechanism of horizontal transport.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1015-1621	1420-9055		WOS:000245007400012	J	"Reinhardt, Liam J.; Hoey, T.

We use simple modelling to quantify the effect of particle spalling and/or landsliding on erosion rates determined using a cosmogenic in-situ produced isotope. Analytical results show that the cosmogenic nuclide concentration of a surface experiencing regular detachment of a grain or block may be considered to be in steady state, and 'in-situ' erosion rates estimated, when an appropriate number of spatially independent samples are amalgamated. We present equations that enable calculation of the number of bedrock samples that must be amalgamated for the estimation of mean erosion rates on an outcrop experiencing regular detachment of a grain or chip of thickness L every T years. Our findings confirm that mean catchment erosion rates may be reliably estimated from ""Be concentrations in fluvial sediment in high-relief rapidly eroding terrain. These catchment-wide integrated erosion rates can be calculated where erosion is primarily accomplished through shallow (< 3 m) spalling processes; where deep-seated (> 3 m) landslides are the dominant mode of erosion only minimum erosion rates can be determined. Lastly, we present erosion rate measurements from the Torrente catchment that reveal variation of two orders of magnitude (0(.)03-1(.)6 m ka(-1)) quantifying the high degree of spatial variation in erosion rates expected within rapidly uplifting catchments.

However, numerous species are threatened by different human activities and by global climatic change. In this work, we provide data on the conservational state of orophilous plants of the Baetic range and propose priorities for their protection. For this, we analysed 82 threatened taxa and 17 mountain areas using correspondence analysis (CA) and complementarity analysis. Of the 2,197.5 km(2) of high-mountain areas analysed, only 1,654.5 km(2) are currently protected (75.3%). Of the 82 threatened species, 16 have no type of protection, eight are critically endangered and six are endangered (according to the categories of the UICN): Overgrazing and natural causes are the main factors threatening most of the species. The Sierra Nevada mountain (Granada and Almeria provinces) and Cazorla-Segura mountain Jaen province) provide protection for 67.5% of the total number of threatened orophilous species, and 71.7% of the species evaluated as critically endangered. We propose Gador and Sagra mountains as new priority areas for the conservation of threatened orophilous flora.									12	2	0	13	1	14			1126-3504			WOS:000245637600001	J	"Lopez-Gonzalez, M.

Although most researchers agree that processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales affect ecological communities, empirical support is still scarce. In this paper, we seek to discern whether the relationship between abundance, biomass, and species diversity, on the one hand, and habitat heterogeneity, on the other, holds across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, we analyse whether the pattern/variation found depends on the taxonomic level, and the diversity index used. To answer these questions, we sampled arthropod assemblages across three nested temporal and spatial scales. In general, we found variability in the responses to habitat heterogeneity across scales according to the assemblage descriptor, the taxonomic level selected, and the diversity index used. Our results suggest that generalization is difficult and extrapolation should be made with caution. Moreover, the use of more than one diversity index would provide additional and complementary information about species-distribution patterns and the mechanisms generating these patterns.									20	2	0	22	3	24			0906-7590			WOS:000244419200004	J	"Ros, R.

In the Granada Depression, the large NW-SE Padul normal fault deforms the SW periclinal end of the Sierra Nevada antiform.

In this context, performed germination experiments were performed with a set of 37 endemic, rare or often endangered, taxa of the Sierra Nevada high mountain (SE Spain), an area that constitutes a hotspot of diversity in the Mediterranean region. Seed germination varied depending on the species, from 0% to ca. 95%. A group of 10 species belonging to 9 families showed a low or null germination percentage. Dormancy in these species is likely to be complex and to involve some kind of physiological ground. A second group of species showed a germination percentage between 5 and 20%, most of these belonging to families producing hard-coated seeds (e.g. Papillionaceae, Geraniaceae). Treatments to promote their germination were thus easy to apply. A large fraction of taxa had a germination percentage above 20%, often above 50%. The germination percentage did not correlate positively with the speed of germination (estimated as the T-50) or with altitude, but correlated negatively (although weakly) with diaspore mass. Families such as Compositae, Cruciferae, Geraniaceae, Labiatae and Papillionaceae are identified as families where seed germination may not imply major problems. Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. nevadensis, Arenaria nevadensis, Carex camposii, Gentiana lutea, Linaria glacialis, Narcissus nevadensis, Nardus stricta, Odontites granatensis, Papaver lapeyrousianum and Sorbus hybrida need studies of dormancy breakage to establish guidelines to optimize management of the scant seed material. As a whole, the results contrast with the generalized idea of a high level of dormancy in alpine species.									18	0	0	16	0	18			0373-2967			WOS:000248403100001	J	"Perez-Aranda, Diana; Carro, Francisco; Garrido, Jose Antonio; Cano, Javier; Castillo, Antonio; Grandados, Jose Enrique; Suarez, Francisco; Soriguer, Ramon C."

Additionally, at the CEAMA a Raman Lidar system based on a Nd:YAG laser source operating at 1064, 532 y 355 nm and including elastic, polarized and Raman shifted detection has been used to derive profiles of several atmospheric aerosol properties. In this paper we present analyses of the changes and temporal evolution detected in atmospheric aerosol vertical profile. Several long range transport episodes have been detected and back-trajectories analyses and synoptic information have been used in the discussion of results.

In this alternance of cherty limestones and thin shaly beds, fusulinellid or anchicodiacean ('phylloid algae') wackestones-packstones and crinoidal rudstones-gramstones are the predominant microfacies, but chaetetid boundstones are conspicuous. These chaetetid occurrences of the Sierra Agua Verde are compared with the accumulations of Arizona, Texas, Kansas and Nevada (USA), and the Cantabric Cordillera (Spain). In Sonora, the environments with chaetetids were quiet, and located below wave base. Shallower facies with staffellids and Komia generally top the chaetetids. Because of the associated micritic deposits, the chaetetids have inhabited probably a soft or firm substrate. As a result of the disphotic-aphotic reconstructed environments, the possible symbionts of the chaetetids are more probably heterotrophic bacteria than autotrophic algae. The most comparable ecological conditions exist in the Atokan Marble Falls Formation of central Texas (USA). Chaetetids are not mentioned in the southern suspect terranes of Mexico, but were possibly present because these regions were located along the probable migration way to Peru, the southernmost area where Pennsylvanian chaetetids are known.

Sierra Nevada (S Spain) is a unique mountain massif within the high-mountain systems of the Mediterranean. It is of great floristic importance and very rich In endemic species. However, it. requires numerous tasks for restoring plant cover due to the constant anthropic degradation, especially because of the ski station located near the second-highest peak of the mountain. One of the restoration efforts consists of trying to reproduce, in the laboratory, the ideal conditions to pre-germinate seeds of some of the species most threatened by these perturbations. This is to transplant the seedlings afterwards in the mountain, thereby contributing to the recovery of these species. With this purpose, a germination experiment was performed, under controlled conditions, with seeds of Genista versicolor Boiss. Hormathophylla spinosa (L.) P. Kupfer, Reseda complicata Bory, and Thymus serpylloides Bory. These four species, native to the Mediterranean high mountains, were germinated under constant darkness, 12 or 24 h light followed by constant darkness, and constant light, at temperatures of 1.5 degrees C or 25 degrees C. The germination process was monitored during 15 days. Results were species-dependent: some species germinated easier under darkness at low temperatures, such as Genista versicolor, whereas Thymus serpylloides presented maximum germination under constant light to a higher temperature.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0031-9457			WOS:000256795000003	S	"Scarciglia, Fabio; Le Pera, Emilia; Critelli, Salvatore"						"Arribas, J; Critelli, S; Johnsson, MJ"		The onset of the sedimentary cycle in a mid-latitude upland environment: Weathering, pedogenesis, and geomorphic processes on plutonic rocks (Sila Massif, Calabria)								SEDIMENTARY PROVENANCE AND PETROGENESIS: PERSPECTIVES FROM PETROGRAPHY AND GEOCHEMISTRY		Geological Society of America Special Papers			420			149	166		10.1130/2006.2420(10)			2007	2007	This work represents an integrated analysis of weathering landforms, including minor landform morphologies and soil profiles developed on granitoid terrains of the Sila Massif uplands (Calabria, southern Italy). The results of our analysis indicate that cryoclastic and thermoclastic processes, along with chemical weathering, are the main factors controlling rock degradation. Microscale features observed in primary minerals and parent rock fabrics, such as structural discontinuities, cleavage planes, fracturing patterns, and variations in chemical composition, play important roles in triggering weathering and, given sufficient time, progressively lead to grussification and soil development. Exfoliation, hydration, and splitting apart of biotite, as well as hydrolysis and etching of plagioclase and K-feldspar, appear to be prominent factors in the breakdown of bedrock.Whereas time controls the degree of development of the main weathering features and climate influences type and intensity of the dominant processes, relief strongly influences the development and preservation/removal of the regolith/soil cover. Geomorphological evidence of severe surface erosion is quite good, especially along steep slopes where weathering products are quickly removed, although on the highest, dissected paleosurfaces (the oldest paleolandscape remnants in the Sila Massif), wide boulder fields represent relics of past, deep spheroidal weathering that have been exhumed by intense erosion. Erosive, depositional, or reworking phenomena, often enhanced by human activity, are well recorded by macro- and micromorphological features of soils, which show simple, poorly differentiated, rejuvenated profiles, buried or truncated horizons, abundant coarse-grained primary minerals or rock fragments, and pedorelicts. The soil clay mineralogy, characterized by illite, chlorite, and vermiculite, and the dominance of coarse textures confirm a young pedogenetic stage of evolution, although highly weathered sand grains (quartz included) occur in rarely preserved mature paleosols. This interpretation is also consistent with the compositional immaturity of fluvial sands, which have undergone low to moderate transport.

A rapid method for measuring K fixation could help clarify relationships with other soil properties, especially mineralogy. Our objectives were to compare some existing measurement techniques for soil K fixation and availability, develop an alternative K fixation test, and evaluate the utility of soil texture and parent material for predicting K fixation in soils derived from granitic Sierra Nevada (SN) and nongranitic Coast Range (CR) alluvium. Potassium pools were estimated by 1 mol L-1 NH4OAc and sodium tetraphenylboron (TPB) extractions. Our 1-h fixation method correlated well (R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.001) with a 7-d procedure, so the 1-h method was used for subsequent work. The SN soils fixed up to 740 mg K kg(-1); CR soils fixed up to 263 mg K kg-1. There was no significant relationship between K fixation and soil clay or silt content for either parent material. The TPB test had a stronger correlation with NH4OAc-extractable K in SN soils (R-2 = 0.77, P= 0.001) than in CR (R-2 = 0.49, P= 0.001). Plant-available nonexchangeable K (PANK = TPB minus NH4OAc) did not correlate with K fixation potential for pooled data from all pedons (R-2 < 0.11), and had negative correlation (R-2 from 0.97 to 0.99, P = 0.01) for individual pedons. The PANK probably represents K that has already been fixed and satisfies some of the K fixation capacity. The 1-h test is a reliable, rapid method for predicting K fixation potential. Together, the TPB and NH4OAc tests could be useful for identifying K already fixed by soils, thereby reducing K fixation potential."									9	2	0	8	0	10			0361-5995			WOS:000243947100017	J	"Tinaut, A.; Martinez-Ibanez, M.D.; Ruano, F."

With these modifications and new contributions, the number of species in Sierra Nevada is raised to 87, three of them, Tapinoma simrothi, Lasius emarginatus and Formica sanguinea remaining still as uncertain records. Out of the total number of species, 22 represent new records from this massif and one of them, Lasius emarginatus, is also a new record for Andalusia. A comparison with previous papers studying the ant fauna of similar massifs, as Sierra de Guadarrama and Sierra de Cazorla, as well as the total number of known species of Andalusia and peninsular Spain, shows that the Sierra Nevada massif is one of the richest of Andalusia. It comprise almost one third of the total number of species of peninsular Spain and 15 species less than Sierra de Guadarrama. However, the number of endemics in Sierra Nevada is very low, only one species being an endemic, probably due to the fact that the cacuminal region (over 2.800 m) in this massif is practically lacking ants, whereas this region usually shows the highest rates of endemic species in mountain regions.									3	0	0	3	0	4			1130-4251			ZOOREC:ZOOR14409056884	J	Ortiz-Sanchez, F.J.

Seedlings emerging early in the growing season often have a greater rate of survival or grow better if early emergence provides advantages with respect to an environmental cue. As a result, the benefits of early emergence may be lost if the environmental stress creating the differences among cohorts disappears. The experimental manipulation under field conditions of the factors that constitute the main sources of stress for seedling establishment is thus a straightforward method to evaluate the impact of date of emergence on seedling establishment under realistic conditions.Methods Two field experiments were performed to analyse the effect of emergence date on survival and first-year growth of Scots pine seedlings in natural mountain forests in south-east Spain. Two main environmental factors that determine seedling success in these mountains were considered: (1) microhabitat type (monitoring the effect of date of emergence in the three most common microhabitats where seedlings recruit); (2) summer drought (monitored by an irrigation treatment with control and watered sampling points).Key Results Overall, early emergence resulted in a higher probability of survival and better growth in the two experiments and across microhabitats. However, the reduction in summer drought did not diminish the differences observed among cohorts: all cohorts increased their survival and growth, but early cohorts still had a clear advantage.Conclusions Date of emergence determines establishment success of Pinus sylvestris seedlings, even if cohorts are separated by only a few days, irrespective of the intensity of summer drought. The experimental design, covering a gradient of light intensity and soil moisture that simulates conditions of the regeneration niche of Scots pine across its geographical range, allows the results to be extrapolated to other areas of the species. Date of emergence is thus likely to have a large impact on the demography of Scots pine across its geographical range."									36	0	0	34	0	36			0305-7364			WOS:000242245400012	17056614J	"Sanchez-Gonzalez, Arturo; Lopez-Mata, Lauro; Vibrans, Heike"								Composition and geographic distribution patterns of the fir forest flora of Cerro Tlaloc, Mexico				COMPOSICION Y PATRONES DE DISTRIBUCION GEOGRAFICA DE LA FLORA DEL BOSQUE DE OYAMEL DEL CERRO TLALOC, MEXICO				Boletin de la Sociedad Botanica de Mexico				79				67	78					Dec-06	2006	"The floristic composition and the distribution of families, genera, and species of vascular plants of the fir forest of Cerro Tlaloc, on the northern Sierra Nevada, were analyzed.

Over a two-year period (1998-1999), six wild species of aromatic and mellipherous plants (Thymus serpylloides subsp. Gadorensis, Thymus baeticus Boiss, Salvia lavandulifolia Vahl., Santolina rosmarinifolia L., Lavandula stoechas L. and Genista umbellata Poiret) were selected for erosion plots to determine their effectiveness in reducing water erosion on hillslopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountain (SE Spain). The erosion plots (including a bare-soil plot as control), located at 1,345 m in altitude, were 2 m(2) (2 m x 1 m) in area and had 13% incline. The lowest runoff and soil erosion rates, ranging from 9 to 26 mm yr(-1) and from 0.01 to 0.31 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under the Thymus serpylloides. Lavandula stoechas L. registered the highest rates among the plant covers tested, runoff ranging from 77 to 127 mm yr(-1) and erosion from 1.67 to 3.50 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). In the bare-soil plot, runoff ranged from 154 to 210 mm yr(-1) and erosion from 4.45 to 7.82 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). According to the results, the lowest-growing plant covers (Thymus serpylloides and Salvia lavandulifolia Vahl.) discouraged the soil erosion and runoff more effectively than did the taller and open medium-sized shrubs (Santolina rosmarinifolia L., Genista umbellata Poiret, Thymus baeticus Boiss and Lavandula stoechas L.). Monitoring allowed more direct linkage to be made between plant covers and the prevention of erosion, with implications for sustainable mountain agriculture and environmental protection.									9	0		7	0	9			0251-1088	1573-2991		BCI:BCI200700159632	J	"Perez, J.

The main objectives of this field campaign were the study of the influence of elevation and atmospheric aerosols on measured UV radiation. In the first stage of the field campaign, a common calibration and intercomparison between Licor-1800 spectroradiometers and Cimel-318 Sun photometers was performed in order to assess the quality of the measurements from the whole campaign. The intercomparison of the Licor spectroradiometers showed, for both direct and global irradiances, that when the comparisons were restricted to the visible part of the spectrum the deviations were within the instruments' nominal accuracies which allows us to rely on these instruments for measuring physical properties of aerosols at the different measurement stations. A simultaneous calibration on AOD data was performed for the Cimel-318 Sun photometers. When a common calibration and methodology was applied, the deviation was lowered to much less than 0.01 for AOD. At the same time an intercomparison has been made between the AOD values given by the spectroradiometers and the Sun photometers, with deviations obtained from 0.01 to 0.03 for the AOD in the visible range, depending on the channel. In the UVA range, the AOD uncertainty was estimated to be around 0.02 and 0.05 for Cimel and Licor respectively. In general the experimental differences were in agreement with this uncertainty estimation. In the UVB range the AOD measurements should not be used due to maximum instrumental uncertainties.									26	0	0	4	0	26			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000240644000001	J	"Forister, Matthew L.; Fordyce, James A.; Nice, Chris C.; Gompert, Zachariah; Shapiro, Arthur M."

At local scales, topography is the most important factor in determining the distribution of solar radiation at the surface. Interpolation techniques are usually employed to estimate solar radiation where stations are not available, but their usefulness is limited where topography is an important source of variability. The use of satellite data and more recently of models based on techniques GIS, have contributed to solve this difficulty. In this work the usefulness of a digital elevation model (DEM) in providing topographic information for the estimation of solar radiation in areas of complex topography is analysed. Daily global radiation values were generated using the Solar Analyst software, which uses topographic information to generate radiation data. The generated data were compared with the experimental data obtained from 14 radiometric stations located within the Sierra Nevada Natural Park (southern Spain), an area of complex topography. Results show the usefulness of the topographic information derived from a DEM to estimate the solar radiation in areas Of complex topography. Nevertheless, results depend on the DEM resolution and it is important that other factors, such as the albedo, should also be taken into account to obtain better estimates.									23	2	0	3	3	23			1350-4827			WOS:000240535000007	J	"Seppa, P.; Fernandez-Escudero, I.; Gyllenstrand, N.; Pamilo, P."

Particularly, evolution towards complex social systems in ants affects how individuals move in space, usually by making females philopatric. Proformica longisetais well-suited for studying the effects of female philopatry, because female sexuals are wingless and do not actively disperse. We studied genetic population structure in P. longiseta in local scale both as genetic viscosity within one subpopulation, and as differentiation between closely (0.1-1.5 km) located subpopulations, by using nuclear (microsatellites) and mitochondrial (SSCP) markers. Dependent colony founding by splitting old nests is the only known nest founding strategy in P. longiseta. However, no genetic viscosity was detected at the nuclear markers within the subpopulation studied, possibly due to the dynamic nature of P. longiseta populations. The extreme female philopatry showed as strong structure between closely located subpopulations in the mitochondrial genome, but there was no isolation by distance showing that the differentiation pattern was random. Genetic structure in the nuclear genome was much weaker, and there was an indication of isolation by distance. This suggests that male dispersal is strong but not totally free across the area. Finally, non-dispersing P. longiseta females necessarily mate locally raising the possibility of inbreeding, but inbreeding coefficients showed that mating is random.									10	0	0	10	0	10			0020-1812			WOS:000239355900018	J	"Morales-Baquero, R; Carrillo, P; Barea-Arco, J; Perez-Martinez, C; Villar-Argaiz, M"				"Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion /I-1601-2015; "	"Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899"			Climate-driven changes on phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling and nutrient availability in high mountain lakes of Southern Europe								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				51	6			989	998		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01545.x			Jun-06	2006	1. The effect of climate variability on phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics and nutrient availability was studied in two high mountain fishless lakes (La Caldera and Rio Seco) of contrasting morphology, hydrology and dissolved inorganic nitrogen : soluble reactive phosphate (DIN : SRP) ratios during 1986 and after a 10-year-long drought in 1996 and 1997.2. Thaw was delayed and water temperatures were lower in both lakes in 1996 than in 1986 and 1997. However, the lake-specific DIN : SRP ratio was maintained in the 3 years studied, reflecting its local control.3. On other hand, the presumptive limiting nutrient in each lake, P in La Caldera and N in Rio Seco, showed higher concentrations in 1996 versus 1986 and 1997. Significant positive correlations between temperature and chlorophyll a were found in both lakes in 1996 but these relationships were negative or not significant in 1986 and 1997. Zooplankton biomass showed lower values in 1996 than in 1986 or 1997.4. These findings can be explained by a decoupling of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction because of a constraint on zooplankton growth by low temperatures in the coldest year studied. This observation furnishes evidence that regional climatic control on the phytoplankton-zooplankton link can modulate the overall demand for nutrients.									11	0	0	10	0	11			0046-5070			WOS:000237692800001	J	"Fuertes, E; Olivan, G; Acon, M"								Warnstorfia (Bryopsida, Calliergonaceae) in the Iberian peninsula								CRYPTOGAMIE BRYOLOGIE				27	2			225	239					Apr-06	2006	A revision of Warnstorfia Loeske from the Iberian Peninsula has been undertaken based on examination of two hundred and four herbarium specimens. The following species are recognized for the Spanish bryological flora: W. exannulata (Schimp.) Loeske, W. fluitans (Hedw.) Loeske and W. sarmentosa (Wahlenb.) Hedenas. W. exannulata is confirmed in Portugal and Andorra and W. fluitans is excluded from the checklist for Portugal and Balearic Islands.All specimens determined in Iberian herbaria as Drepanocladus aduncus var. asturicus (Renauld) Riehm., D. exannulatus subfo. falcifolius Moenk., D. exannulatus var. alpinus (Grav.) Wijk & Margad. and D. fluitans var. falcatus (C.E.O. Jensen) G. Roth, have been re-identified as Warnstorfia exannulata.Warnstorfia exannulata is common in the mountainous areas of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Regions of the northern and central part of the Iberian Peninsula, in three distinct areas: Pyrenees, Iberian-Atlantic Ranges (Galician-Portuguese Massif, Cantabrian Range, and Central Range), and Sierra Nevada (south Spain), although it is very rare in the latter. W. fluitans and W. sarmentosa are rare as both have higher moisture requirements than W. exannulata. Their distribution is limited to the mountains of the Eurosiberian Region of Spain, from the Cantabrian Range to the Pyrenees, where there is a strong Atlantic influence. The threats to Warnstorfia populations in the Iberian Peninsula are analyzed.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1290-0796			WOS:000237317300003	J	"Baraza, E; Zamora, R; Hodar, JA"				Baraza, Elena/H-2546-2015	Baraza, Elena/0000-0002-2928-3978			Conditional outcomes in plant-herbivore interactions: neighbours matter								OIKOS				113	1			148	156		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14265.x			Apr-06	2006	Spatial distribution of palatable and unpalatable plants can influence the foraging behaviour of herbivores, thereby changing plant-damage probabilities. Moreover, the immediate proximity to certain plants can benefit other plants that grow below them, where toxicity or spines act as a physical barrier or concealment against herbivores. This paper presents the results of a multi-scale experiment performed to test the effect of shrubs as protectors of tree saplings against herbivores and the mechanism involved in Mediterranean ecosystems. We performed a factorial design in two mountain ranges, similar in physiognomy and vegetation, planting saplings of a palatable tree, the maple (Acer opalus subsp. granatense), and an unpalatable tree, the black pine (Pinus nigra), under three different types of shrubs. We considered four experimental microhabitats: highly palatable shrub (Amelanchier ovalis), palatable but spiny shrub (Crataegus monogyna or Prunus ramburii), unpalatable spiny shrub (Berberis vulgaris subsp. australis) and control (gaps of bare soil without shrubs). Three main factors were found to determine the probability of sapling attack: sapling palatability, experimental microhabitat and plot. Palatable saplings (maples) were browsed much more than unpalatable ones (pines). The degree of protection provided by the shrub proved greater as its palatability decreased with respect to sapling palatability, the unpalatable spiny shrub being the safest microhabitat for palatable saplings and bare soil for unpalatable ones. The differences found in number of attacked saplings between plots may be attributable to differences in herbivore pressure. The community context in which interaction takes place, namely the characteristics of the neighbours and the intensity of herbivore pressure, are determining factors for understanding and predicting the damage undergone by a target plant species. The mechanism that best explains these results is associational avoidance of saplings that grow near to unpalatable shrubs. It is necessary to introduce this neighbour effect in theoretical models and food-web approaches that analyse the plant-herbivore relationships, since it can strongly determine not only the intensity of the interaction, but also the spatial distribution and diversity of the plant community.									101	2	0	96	1	102			0030-1299			WOS:000235418400014	J	"Martinez, JRF; Zuazo, VHD; Raya, AM"				Francia Martinez, Jose Ramon/H-7663-2015	Francia Martinez, Jose Ramon/0000-0003-0251-1501			Environmental impact from mountainous olive orchards under different soil-management systems (SE Spain)								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				358	01-Mar			46	60		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.05.036			APR 1 2006	2006	"Soil erosion, runoff and nutrient-loss patterns over a two-year period (1999-2000) were monitored in erosion plots on a mountainside with olive (Olea europaea cv.

In the Granada basin, according to the interpretation of the seismic profiles and results of the backstripping analysis, subsidence and sedimentation rates were at a maximum in the late Tortonian and decreased progressively; meanwhile, the neighbouring areas were uplifted forming important relief. Chronostratigraphical revisions of the marine sediments show that the marine incursion that deposited sediments in the Granada basin lasted only 1.3 Ma, between 8.5 and 7.2 Ma. The gradual retreat of the sea in the Granada basin is not attributable to global eustatic fluctuations, but rather to uplift in the Sierra Nevada and its adjacent areas. From latest Tortonian to early Messinian times, the region became continental and the Granada basin acquired its present physiography and was differentiated as such. From the late Tortonian onwards, NNW-SSE compression combined with ENE-WSW extension affected the cordillera. In the Granada basin, extension controlled fault movements. There are two well-defined fault sets: the first trends 70 degrees N-90 degrees E, with low angle faults (less than 30 degrees) dipping towards the north and south, defining the subsiding areas which have approximately E-W direction; whereas the second set has a NW-SE direction, and cuts and displaces the previous ones, defining the main subsiding areas in the eastern part of the basin. The reinterpretation of seismic profiles reveals that the subsiding axes within the Granada basin persisted from the Tortonian to the present because of continued displacements of the main faults."									41	0	0	5	0	41			0950-091X			WOS:000235984200004	J	"Morales-Baquero, R; Pulido-Villena, E; Reche, I"				"Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; "	"Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899"			Atmospheric inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen to the southwest Mediterranean region: Biogeochemical responses of high mountain lakes								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				51	2			830	837					Mar-06	2006	We quantified dry and wet deposition of dust, nitrogen, and phosphorus over the southwest Mediterranean region (Sierra Nevada, Spain) and assessed its effects on the nutrient status and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in two high mountain lakes, Atmospheric deposition of particulate matter (PM) and total phosphorus (TP) were mainly associated with dryfall and showed a seasonal pattern similar to that reported for Saharan dust export toward the Mediterranean region, with maxima during spring and summer. In contrast, total nitrogen (TN) deposition was related to rainfall and did not follow the pattern observed for PM and TP. The molar TN: TP ratio was significantly lower (i.e., phosphorus-enriched) in dry deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 11.2) than in wet deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 95.5). In the study lakes, the molar TN: TP ratios and the Chl a concentrations were significantly influenced by the molar TN: TP ratio and the TP content of atmospheric deposition, respectively. Lake responses were more pronounced in the more phosphorous-limited system. These results establish a direct connection between atmospheric deposition and lake nutrient status and Chl a, making evident that in the Mediterranean region these inputs are an important source of phosphorous affecting biogeochemistry of oligotrophic systems.									72	1	0	56	0	73			0024-3590			WOS:000236343600004	J	"Arillo, A.; Subias, L.

This second record was not included in the revision of the series Fauna Iberica by Perez-Inigo (1997). Neither specimen was recorded in a cave, but now a third specimen has been found in a cave in southern Spain and the presence of this species in Spain is confirmed. Metabelbella phalangioides corn. nov. could be a truly troglobic species because the specimen is rather pale coloured despite having a great body size. We assigned the new specimen to this species due (among other features) to the great development of its legs, the longest known among oribatid mites, although species with legs longer than the body are not uncommon in the family Damaeidae.

Although several studies have focused on the effect of exotic fishes on native amphibians breeding in ponds or lakes, little is known about their effects on stream-breeding species. We studied the effects of introductions of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) on the stream-breeding, endemic Iberian frog (Rana iberica) in a protected area in central Spain. We assessed occurrence patterns of tadpoles and salmonids and compared habitat use of the three species. We also determined experimentally whether chemical cues from salmonids elicited antipredator behavior in tadpoles. Finally, we assessed the relative influence of tadpole habitat preferences, differences in salmonid species, and invasion geography on tadpole occurrence. Despite widely overlapping habitat preferences, tadpoles and trout did not coexist, with the former restricted to fishless habitats. Tadpoles detected chemical cues from both trout species and reacted by decreasing their activity, although the response toward the native brown trout was stronger. The residual distribution of Iberian frogs in Penalara is better explained by the geography of fish invasions than by the fish species involved. Measures such as fish extirpation from certain areas, aimed at recovering lost habitat and improving connectivity among remaining populations of Iberian frogs, seem critical for the species' long-term survival in central Spain.									23	0	0	24	0	26			0888-8892			WOS:000235367100019	16909671J	Moscoso, DJ								Obstacles and opportunities for mountain development in Andalusia (Spain) - The experience of the European Union LEADER Initiative for rural development in the Sierra Nevada								MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT				26	1			81	83		"10.1659/0276-4741(2006)026[0081:OAOFMD]2.0.CO;2"			Feb-06	2006										1	0	0	1	0	1			0276-4741			WOS:000236067000017	J	"Garrido, J.A.; Irurita, J.M.; Olvera, S.; Tortosa, E.; Valdivieso, O.; Lopez-Sanjuan, R.; Seminario, Y.; Acevedo, J."

It is operated and maintained by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA-CSIC) and contains two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5 and 0.9m and an Altazimuth telescope with an aperture of 0.6m. Given that the quality of the images and, indeed, the performance of the instruments are influenced by weather conditions, it would appear that the existence of a weather station capable of producing accurate descriptions is an essential component of any observatory. This is particularly true, however, in our case where, given the altitude, weather conditions at certain times of the year are especially harsh(1). For this reason, our observatory has required the installation of a robust weather station with easily replaceable sensors which can provide accurate and reliable measures of wind, temperature and humidity(2). At the same time, in order to avoid a complex topology of unmanageably long wires due to the distribution of a large number of sensors around the buildings, domes telescope mirrors and instruments, it has been necessary to implement a distributed system with several independent nodes connected to a CAN bus. This system is now in operation and running automatically at the OSN and provides all the data from sensors to the observatory control systems and to internet users.This paper gives a detailed description of the SNOWS project, including the development of the weather station, the software and hardware architecture, and the use of distributed nodes with a linear serial bus. The paper also provides some results regarding the wind, temperature and humidity sensors employed at the OSN.

Our study will focus on two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5m and 0.9m and an equatorial mount. The system currently installed to control these telescopes is a 1995 centralized VME module. However, given the problems which have arisen due to the number of wires and other complications, we have decided to change this control module.We will control each telescope with a distributed control philosophy, using a serial linear communication bus between independent nodes, although all system capabilities are accessible from a central unit anywhere and at any time via internet. We have divided the tasks and have one node for alpha control, another for delta control, one for the dome, one for the focus and the central unit to interface with a pc.The nodes for alpha, delta and the dome will be used by means of FPGA's in order to efficiently sample the encoders and the control algorithms, and to generate the output for the motors and the servo. The focus will have a microcontroller, and the system is easy to expand in the event of the inclusion of more nodes.After having studied several fieldbus systems, we have opted for the CAN bus, because of its reliability and broadcasting possibilities. In this way, all the important information will be on the bus, and every node will be able to access the information at any time.This document explains the new design made in the IAA for the new consoles of control whose basic characteristics are, the distributed control, the hardware simplify, the cable remove, the safety and maintenance improve and facilitating the observation improving the interface with the user, and finally to prepare the system for the remote observation.

Study of a large number of specimens (males) has lead to solutions for most problems. M. servatum (Navas 1918), distributed in the NW parts of the Peninsula, M. cenerentola Schmid 1952, known from Central and NW Spain, and M. salardum Schmid 1952, from the Spanish Oriental Pyreneans, are all distinct species. M. gabusi Schmid 1952, described from the Sierra Nevada, was found to be a synonym of M. longulum McLachlan 1876, a species widely distributed (i.a.) in Spain. M. difficile Mosely 1933, described from the French Pyreneans, proves to be a synonym of M. vestitum Navas, 1918, the species being endemic for the Central and Western Pyreneans (France and Spain). A special problem is that of M. moestum (Hagen 1868): it is possible that under this name a pair of cryptic species is concealed, practically not distinguished by their genitalia, but with well distinct larvae.									2	0	0	2	0	3			0037-9271			WOS:000237536200013	J	"Gomez Ortiz, Antonio; Plana Castellvi, Josep A."

A critical reading and analysis of these documents give information of great interest in Geomorphology, as it has been demonstrated during the Sierra Nevada Little Ice Age in Sierra Nevada.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0212-9426			WOS:000243938000005	J	"Errard, Christine; Ruano, Francisca; Richard, Freddie-Jeanne; Lenoir, Alain; Tinaut, Alberto; Hefetz, Abraham"				"Hefetz, Abraham/I-3853-2015; "	Ruano, Francisca/0000-0002-9806-7267			Co-evolution-driven cuticular hydrocarbon variation between the slave-making ant Rossomyrmex minuchae and its host Proformica longiseta (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)								CHEMOECOLOGY				16	4			235	240		10.1007/s00049-006-0358-4			2006	2006	"Proformica longiseta exists as two populations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Spain, only one of which is parasitized by the slave-maker ant Rossomyrmex minuchae. To investigate the possible effect of co-evolutionary pressures on cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles (the presumed nestmate recognition cues), we performed a comparative analysis of the CHC of R. minuchae and P. longiseta colonies from both the allopatric and sympatric populations; the latter includes samples of enslaved as well as free-living workers. Discriminant analyses based on these chemical profiles showed two clear profile groups: the first comprised R. minuchae and both enslaved and free-living P. longiseta from the sympatric population; and the second the allopatric P. longiseta workers. As expected, the profiles of the two sympatric P. longiseta groups (enslaved and free-living) were distinct; but, interestingly, those of the enslaved P. longiseta and its parasite R. minuchae were also distinguishable. This indicates that despite their cohabitation each species maintains its own chemical identity. Profile similarity between the sympatric free-living P. longiseta and its parasite may explain the lower than expected aggression observed during raids. We further speculate that in view of the differences between the sympatric and allopatric population of P. longiseta, co-evolutionary pressures have driven changes in the profile of the former to better match that of its parasite R. minuchae. Such an adjustment may have enabled nests of the sympatric P. longiseta to endure multiple raids by the parasite (due to the reduced aggression) and thus to continue to reproduce despite the damage inflicted by the raids."									11	0	0	11	0	11			0937-7409			WOS:000243259900008	J	"Larena, Belen Gutierrez; Aguilar, Javier Fuertes; Feliner, Gonzalo Nieto"				Fuertes Aguilar, Javier/A-3974-2010	Fuertes Aguilar, Javier/0000-0001-5649-4845			Dispersal across Southern Iberian refugia? Integrating rapds, sequence data and morphometrics in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae)								FOLIA GEOBOTANICA				41	3			305	322		10.1007/BF02904944			2006	2006	A southern Spanish massif (Tejeda/Almijara range, Malaga province, SE Spain) has been previously identified as a contact zone for genotypes of a rare taxon, Armeria villosa subsp. bernisii, and a frequent one, A. filicaulis, based on (1) the discovery of a species-independent geographically structured pattern of variation for nuclear ribosomal ITS sequence data, and (2) the sharing of chloroplast haplotypes, which reveal horizontal transfer between the species. This study uses RAPD data, as a total DNA marker, and morphometrics, as potentially revealing hybridization and introgression, to throw further light on the origin of the above mentioned contact zone. Individuals of the two taxa sampled from the range do not show a F1 hybrid profile for RAPD or for morphometrics. To integrate these results with the previously published sequence data (ITS and chloroplast spacer trnL-F) it is proposed that introgressive hybridization has occurred in A. villosa subsp. bernisii, whereas for A. filicaulis the contact zone occurs at the intraspecific level. With the available data, the contact between individuals of Armeria with different genotypes in the two taxa may have implied westward migration from a biodiverse massif like Sierra Nevada, and this may apply to other organisms although further data are needed to confirm it.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1211-9520			WOS:000239529200005	J	Martinez-Martinez, JM					Martinez Martinez, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-8178-0904			Lateral interaction between metamorphic core complexes and less-extended, tilt-block domains: the Alpujarras strike-slip transfer fault zone (Betics, SE Spain)								JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY				28	4			602	620		10.1016/j.jsg.2006.01.012			2006	2006	The Alpujarras area in southeastern Spain exhibits one of the scant documented examples of extension related strike-slip faults bordering core complexes in the world. Faults of the Alpujarras fault zone define a regional-scale complex ENE-striking transfer zone that marks the boundary among the Sierra Nevada elongated dome, a highly-extended, constricted core-complex, and a less-extended domain formed by large-scale tilt-blocks. Detailed mapping and structural analysis show that the Alpujarras fault zone is an integral part of the WSW-directed normal fault systems that thinned the Betic hinterland during the middle Miocene to Recent time. Fault patterns and palaeostress analysis both indicate that dextral movement along the strike-slip faults was induced by a local stress field with a sub-horizontal E-W- to ESE-WNW-trending maximum principal stress axis, which is synchronous with the regional stress field driving the normal fault systems. Palaeostress analysis also indicates subsequent variations in the stress field with a sub-horizontal NW-SE- to N-S-trending maximum principal stress axis, thus producing both the tectonic inversion of the northern fault of the Alpujarras system and shortening of the unloaded extensional detachment footwall. A simplified kinematic model for the tectonic evolution of the Alpujarras area from the middle Miocene to Recent emphasizes the kinematic coupling of normal faults and strike-slip transfer zones in the extensional process.

The erosion plots (580 m a.s.l.), located on a 35 per cent slope, were 144 m(2) (24 m x 6 m) in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. The most effective plant cover proved to be thyme, reducing soil loss by 97 percent and runoff by 91 per cent, compared to bare soil. Barley reduced soil loss by 87 per cent and runoff by 59 per cent, compared to bare soil, while these percentages were 58 per cent and 18 per cent for lentils. Thyme proved 77 per cent more effective than barley and 93 per cent more effective than lentils in reducing soil loss; thyme was also 79 per cent more effective than barley and 90 percent more than lentil in blocking runoff.

Moreover, genetic distances between Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees populations were always higher than those between populations from the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. This suggests successive disruption of gene exchange between mountain ranges as postglacial climatic warming proceeded from south to north.In Papaver alpinum, our data indicate that a central Pyrenean population arose via long-distance dispersal from the Sierra Nevada, and that vicariant separation events between the Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees and between the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps occurred simultaneously.Overall, Sierra Nevada populations of all species investigated here preserve unexpectedly high (or not exceptionally reduced) genetic diversity. This testifies to the important influence of long-term isolation, i.e. vicariance, on genetic diversity through fostering the accumulation of new mutations and/or the fixation of ancestral ones.									59	0	1	59	0	62			0028-646X			WOS:000239988100018	16945099S	"Azanon, J.

This topographic depression is a plateau with an average elevation of 1000 m in the northern limb of the Sierra Nevada range. The continental deposits infilling the Guadix basin span time from the late Tortonian to the Pleistocene, when a laminar calcrete developed on fine-to coarse-grained fluvial and lacustrine deposits. The drainage pattern is strongly incised (up to 200 m) below the calcrete layer. Four coeval subsamples from the top laminae of the calcrete were collected and dated by the U/Th method. The resulting date is 42.6 +/- 5.6 ka, which indicates the minimum age for the cessation of active sedimentation in the Guadix basin. Using this age, we have calculated the incision and erosion rates for the late Pleistocene to present-day time span in the Arroyo de Gor, a highly incised canyon in the eastern border of the Guadix basin. The minimum incision rates in this canyon are around 4 mm/yr. We envisage the capture of the Pliocene-Pleistocene endorheic Guadix basin by the Guadalquivir River after 42 ka as the main factor triggering the formation of the present-day eroded landscape. After the capture, the combination of climatic (wet periods), lithological (soft and loose sediments), and topographic (high average altitude) features allowed the development of the present-day entrenched drainage pattern.									12	0	0	1	0	12			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2416-4	WOS:000272343100015	B	"Padial, Jose M.; Romero-Pujante, Marilo; Hernandez, Francisco J.; Donazar, Jose A.; Godino, Alfonso; Carrasco, Antonio; Couto, Sergio; Gutierrez, Jose E.; Ruiz, Antonio; Garcia-Baquero, Maria J.; Simon, Miguel A."

The GLM model selected four variables: altitude, topographic irregularity, distance to village and distance to the nearest neighbouring breeding pair. A GIS was used to obtain digital models for each variable. We validated the GLM model testing it with new nest sites in a different geographical context, without including distance to neighbouring pairs. According to the model, in Andalusia the areas with probability > 0.8 coincided with the main mountain ranges. Of these, we selected only protected areas within the historical range of the species. Thus, eight protected areas were considered and surveyed to evaluate their feasibility for reintroduction. We gathered information at two geographical scales:1-km and 15-km radius around high-probability cliffs. We summarised environmental information on habitat quality and threat level in a matrix that made it possible to compare the viability of reintroduction in each of these eight areas. Poisoning cases and the density of power lines were the most restrictive variables. Sierra Nevada National Park, which was expected to be one of the best areas, showed a high level of threat because of power lines, cable cars and outdoor activities. These threats, however, could be easily mitigated by implementing reintroduction actions. Two protected areas, the Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park and the Alhama, Tejeda yAlmijara Natural Park, were the most suitable areas for a reintroduction.									0	0		0	0	0					960-367-023-5	ZOOREC:ZOOR14305034018	J	"Campos, Francisco; Gutierrez-Corchero, Francisco; Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus; Hernandez, Ma Angeles"								A new criteria to sex European dippers Cinclus cinclus in the Iberian Peninsula.

Birds from the Sierra Nevada were the largest but there were no significant differences among the other three areas. In the north, the range of the C. c. cinclus and C. c. aquatictis subspecies overlapped. In the south only aquaticus was present and in the central mountains only cinclus. The biometrics of cinclus in the north and centre were similar but aquaticus was larger in the south than the north. Spanish populations of C. cinclus thus appear to go against the predictions of Bergmann's rule. The residual index (RI) was calculated for individual birds from the regression of mass/tarsus length. RI was higher in males than females in the northern populations, but the same in the centre and south. According to this index, males (but not females) were heavier than the theoretical weight in the north and lighter in the centre and southern ranges. Some other variations in the Spanish populations are also discussed.									7	0	0	8	0	8			Jan-54			WOS:000234621300001	J	"Gonzalez-Megias, A; Gomez, JM; Sanchez-Pinero, F"				Sanchez Pinero, Francisco/L-2629-2014				Regional dynamics of a patchily distributed herbivore along an altitudinal gradient								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				30	6			706	713		10.1111/j.0307-6946.2005.00745.x			Dec-05	2005	1. Metapopulation dynamics should be more important at the borders of species distributions due to two main factors: (1) populations are less abundant and fluctuate more at the borders than in the centre of their distributions, and (2) resources in the range margins of species distributions are often more scarce and fragmented.2. Most metapopulation studies have been performed in a fraction of the entire distribution of species. The main goal here is to study the population dynamics of a narrowly distributed species including both the borders and the centre of the distribution, and to test the predictions described above.3. The density and extinction events in a patchily distributed species, Timarcha lugens, was quantified for 5 years along an altitudinal gradient including the upper and lower limits of the species distribution. The dispersal ability of Timarcha was also studied using a mark-release-recapture study.4. Extinction events and empty patches were only found at the borders of Timarcha distribution. The fluctuation in beetle density was greater in patches suffering extinction events. Resource abundance was negatively related to beetle density and positively related to extinction events. In addition, the dispersal rate among patches was very low and beetles moved distances of no further than 25 in.5. Population density governs the extinction events in this system, and its fluctuation was more evident near the border of the distribution. Both factors together with the relative population stability in patches at medium and high altitudes, and the low dispersal rate of the individuals support the idea of a source-sink metapopulation structure in T. lugens.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0307-6946			WOS:000234482500011	J	"Gonzalez-Megias, A; Gomez, JM; Sanchez-Pinero, F"				Sanchez Pinero, Francisco/L-2629-2014				Consequences of spatial autocorrelation for the analysis of metapopulation dynamics								ECOLOGY				86	12			3264	3271		10.1890/05-0387			Dec-05	2005	The importance of spatial and temporal autocorrelation for the processes occurring at many different scales has been pointed out in the last few years. Although the role of spatial pattern in models on metapopulation dynamics has recently been recognized, there is a lack of empirical studies accounting for the consequences of considering autocorrelation in these processes. Here, we show that the conventional statistical methods used for determining the factors controlling species population dynamics (species density, sex ratio, and extinction events) can be strongly affected by spatial autocorrelation. Under these circumstances, the use of a spatially explicit model is highly recommended in order to demonstrate the real factor controlling species population dynamics. Moreover, presenting erroneous conclusions concerning the real factors governing species population dynamics could have far-reaching consequences in the management and conservation of many endangered species.									24	0	0	22	0	24			Dec-58			WOS:000234066700017	J	"Tirado, R; Pugnaire, FI"				Pugnaire, Francisco/A-7150-2008	Pugnaire, Francisco/0000-0002-1227-6827			Community structure and positive interactions in constraining environments								OIKOS				111	3			437	444		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2005.14094.x			Dec-05	2005	Spatial patterns in plant communities are thought to be controlled by the interplay of species interactions and environmental constraints. To evaluate the role of plant-plant interactions in shaping these communities we quantified species co-occurrence and interaction in seven environmentally distinct communities. These included four different semiarid habitats in southeast Spain, one alpine system in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain), and two sites in Venezuela, a secondary savanna near Caracas (Altos de Pipe), and a sclerophyllous shrubland in the Gran Sabana plateau. We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects. Facilitation appears as a relevant process shaping communities under environmental constraints.									65	6	0	65	2	74			0030-1299			WOS:000233306800003	J	"Pala-Paul, J; Perez-Alonso, MJ; Velasco-Negueruela, A; Varade, J; Villa, AM; Sanz, J; Brophy, JJ"					Varade, Jezabel/0000-0002-3964-110X			Analysis of the essential oil composition from the different parts of Eryngium glaciale Boiss. from Spain								JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A				1094	01-Feb			179	182		10.1016/j.chroma.2005.09.029			NOV 11 2005	2005	The essential oil from the different parts (inflorescences, stems + leaves and roots) of Eryngium glaciale Boiss. gathered in Sierra Nevada (Spain) has been extracted by steam distillation and analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.

The inter-species values for pairwise genetic distance obtained by using the Jaccard index are in the range 0.72-0.79. The intraspecies values found using the same index are between 0.03 and 0.38 in the case of P. andalusica and between 0.00 (genetically identical) and 0.47 in the case of P. bolanderi. This range points to the high genetic diversity of P. bolanderi, which is considered as a rare species.

We studied the strategy used by Rossomyrmex minuchae queens to invade their host Proformica longiseta. Field observations revealed that queens enter the host nest unchallenged by the host workers in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Pre-usurpation queens were found to possess a highly inflated Dufour's gland, which considerably reduces in size after successful usurpation. Chemical analysis of these queen glands revealed tetradecanal to be the major product in pre-usurpation Rossomyrmex queens, but to be almost absent in queens that have been adopted by P. longiseta. We consequently hypothesized that tetradecanal is a repellent that is used by queens to prevent host worker aggression. We tested its repellent effect by attempting to deter starved, highly motivated workers from a droplet of honey. Tetradecanal indeed proved to be highly repellent both to host worker P. longiseta and non-host worker Formica selysi. It was even more powerful than limonene, a reported general ant repellent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that R. minuchae queens use Dufour's gland secretion as a weapon during nest usurpation. The general use of tetradecanal as a defensive compound, and its seemingly non-specific repellent effect on ants, indicate that it may act as a general ant repellent. Its adoption by R. minuchae queens thus provides them with an efficient defensive and offensive chemical weapon during their long and risky search for new host nests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of flow on streamwater concentrations and seasonal differences in quality and origin of dissolved organic matter, inferred from dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen ratios (DOC:DON ratios), were examined. During baseflow conditions, nitrate and ammonium had opposite behaviour, probably controlled by biological processes such as vegetation uptake and mineralization activity. DON concentrations did not have a seasonal trend. During storms, nitrate and DON increased by several times but discharge was not a good predictor of nutrient concentrations.

Spain)								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				149	6			627	646		10.1007/s00410-005-0678-3			Aug-05	2005	Rocks of the Cerro del Almirez ultramafic massif (Sierra Nevada, Betic Cordillera, S. Spain) record the high-pressure dehydration of antigorite-olivine serpentinite to form chlorite harzburgite (ol + opx + chl). In the field, these two rock types are separated by a well-defined isograd. Titanian clinohumite (TiCl) and olivine show textural and compositional differences depending on the rock type. OH-TiCl occurs in the serpentinite as disseminated grains and in veins. F-OH-TiCl is observed exclusively in the chlorite harzburgite, where it occurs as porphyroblastic grains and within prograde olivine as irregular and lamellar, planar intergrowths at microscopic and submicroscopic scales. Petrological evidence of partial to complete breakdown of TiCl to olivine + ilmenite is preserved in both rock types. Chlorite harzburgite is characterized by a brown pleochroic olivine with abundantally oriented microscopic to submicroscopic oxide particles. The mean Ti-content of the brown olivine is 144 ppm. The brown olivine preserves TiCl lamellae that sometimes grade into ghost lamellae outlined by the oxide trails. This observation suggests that some of the oxide inclusions in the brown olivine are derived from the breakdown of TiCl intergrowths. Thermodynamic modelling of selected Almirez bulk rock compositions indicates a temperature increase from 635 degrees C to 695 degrees C, at pressures ranging from 1.7 GPa to 2.0 GPa, as the cause for the compositional adjustment of TiCl between the Almirez antigorite serpentinite and chlorite harzburgite. These P-T estimates are in good agreement with the sequence of phase relations observed in the field. The computed phase diagrams in conjunction with the geothermal conditions envisaged for different subduction settings indicate that TiCl is stable in the vicinity of the antigorite serpentinite/chlorite harzburgite phase boundary in some subduction settings. In these circumstances, clinohumite-olivine intergrowths in chlorite harzburgite may act as a sink for high field strength elements, and probably other elements, that are present in the mantle-wedge fluids.									44	0	0	0	1	44			Oct-99	1432-0967		WOS:000231519000001	J	"Augier, R; Jolivet, L; Robin, C"				Jolivet, Laurent/D-5598-2009	Jolivet, Laurent/0000-0002-2596-2017			Late Orogenic doming in the eastern Betic Cordilleras: Final exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride complex and its relation to basin genesis								TECTONICS				24	4					TC4003	10.1029/2004TC001687			JUL 13 2005	2005	"The geometry, timing, and kinematics of late orogenic extension in the Betic Cordilleras pose the problem of a decoupling of upper crustal and lower crustal deformation regimes. Perpendicular directions of extension in metamorphic domes and nearby sedimentary basins remain unexplained. This paper puts kinematic constraints on the final exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride complex, focusing on the formation of metamorphic domes and their relations with the adjacent basins. Structural fabrics and kinematic indicators below the main shear zones as well as their relations with both published changing metamorphic P-T conditions and geochronological data were studied. Our approach describes (1) a consistent top-to-the-west shear parallel to dome axes of during D2 (i.e., during decompression) with distributed ductile flow and the onset of strain localization along major shear zones, (2) further strain localization along the major shear zones under greenschist facies conditions, during D3 leading to S-C' mylonites formation accompanied with a rock strong thickness reduction, (3) the divergence of shear direction on either limbs of domes during D3 showing the appearance of the dome geometry, and (4) a local evolution toward N-S brittle extension (D4) in the upper plate and formation of sedimentary basins. Continuous ductile to brittle top-to-the-west shear is compatible with the slab retreat hypothesis from the Miocene; the formation of domes which adds gravitational forces responsible for the final stages of exhumation is thus characterized by important kinematics changes necessary to explain coeval N-S opened basins. Later, from the upper Tortonian, a contractional event (D5) amplified the earlier domal structures forming the present north vergent folds. Citation: Augier, R., L. Jolivet, and C.

OTU composition among lakes was heterogeneous, and the number of site-specific OTUs was near 50%. Lake remoteness did not affect the number of bacterial OTUs although the spatial distribution of the lakes significantly influenced bacterial composition. Lakes that were closer together had more similar bacterial fingerprints. We found a consistent positive association between bacterial OTU richness and lake area.

The mating behaviour of the entire genus Rossomyrmex is virtually unknown. We present here the results of a 3-year study of mating behaviour in R. minuchae.Behavioural observations and limited nest excavations revealed that R. minuchae does not produce sexuals every year, the number of sexuals is low, and the sex ratio tends to be female biased. Females typically exhibit two distinct activity periods. The first, the mating period, takes place in early afternoon: the ants ""call"" near the natal nest, mate and then return to their nest. The second, the dispersal period takes place in late afternoon: the mated females exit their nest and fly in search of a new, non-parasitized Proformica longiseta host nest. Males are highly active during the mating period, but will remain inactive in the dispersal period even if experimentally presented with virgin females. It appears that females are monogamous, while males are polygamous. When males are late arriving at the female calling site, the females will frequently congregate presumably calling in chorus.The low reproductive efficiency exhibited by R. minuchae, coupled with the postulated low genetic variation in the population, as sisters may mate with the same male, could result in a low survival rate and risk of eventual extinction. The observed decrease in nest density we observed during the 2004 season may be indicative of such a process."									8	1	0	8	0	8			0028-1042			WOS:000231020400006	15864511J	"Donaire, T; Pascual, E; Pin, C; Duthou, JL"				Donaire, Teodosio/P-7032-2014	Donaire, Teodosio/0000-0001-5582-2253			Microgranular enclaves as evidence of rapid cooling in granitoid rocks: the case of the Los Pedroches granodiorite, Iberian Massif, Spain								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				149	3			247	265		10.1007/s00410-005-0652-0			May-05	2005	Microgranular enclaves from the Los Pedroches granodiorite (LPG) (Los Pedroches Batholith, Iberian Massif, Spain) have Sr-Nd isotopic and mineral chemical compositions close to those of their host. This similarity is not related to restite unmixing, as indicated by the igneous textures of the enclaves. A number of other geological and geochemical lines of evidence, including the high REE and HFSE contents of the microgranular enclaves relative to the host granitoid, strongly suggest that this similarity cannot be explained by magma mixing. Alternatively, a crystallization process by rapid cooling within the host granitoid magma could explain the geochemical and textural characteristics of the microgranular enclaves, including shape, grain size, mineralogy, texture, chemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic composition. Such a crystallization occurred at the walls of the magma conduits through which the granitic magmas were emplaced in the upper crust. This process should be considered as an alternative hypothesis to magma mixing for the generation of some microgranular enclaves, especially where no direct evidence exists for the presence of basic magmas coeval with granitoids, and where there is a lack of isotopic contrast between hosts and enclaves. As the process is favoured by feeder-dyke related emplacement, we suggest that abundance of microgranular enclaves can be related to the mechanism of emplacement of granitoid bodies.									53	8	0	1	0	59			Oct-99	1432-0967		WOS:000228880200001	J	Gomez, JM								Long-term effects of ungulates on performance, abundance, and spatial distribution of two montane herbs								ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS				75	2			231	258		10.1890/04-0722			May-05	2005	"Herbivores highly reduce the performance of many plant species. However, little empirical information exists on the real effect that these organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year) ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E. baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was nonsignificant, although &GT; 50% of Erysimum seedlings died due to ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species. Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat distribution and niche structure."									39	0	0	38	0	41			Dec-15			WOS:000228917300006	J	"Gomez-Aparicio, L; Gomez, JM; Zamora, R; Boettinger, JL"								Canopy vs. soil effects of shrubs facilitating tree seedlings in Mediterranean montane ecosystems								JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE				16	2			191	198		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2005.tb02355.x			Apr-05	2005	"Question: Is the facilitative effect of nurse shrub,. on early recruitment of trees mediated by a 'canopy effect' (microclimate amelioration and protection from herbivores), a 'soil effect' (modification of soil properties), or both?Location: Two successional montane shrublands at the Sierra Nevada Protected Area, SE Spain.Method: Seedlings of Quercus and Pinus species were planted in four experimental treatments: (1) under shrubs; (2) in open interspaces without vegetation; (3) under shrubs where the canopies were removed-, (4) in open interspaces but covering seedlings with branches, mimicking a shrub canopy.Results: Both effects benefited seedling performance.

The abundance and diversity of the pollinator assemblage of plants excluded from and exposed to mammalian herbivores, and the combined effect of pollinators and herbivores on plant reproduction were determined over a period of 2 years. Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from herbivores. Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and herbivores affected plant fitness, but their effects were not independent. Herbivores only had a detrimental effect on plant fitness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced fitness only when herbivores were excluded. This outcome demonstrates that the importance of pollinators for plant fitness depends on the occurrence of herbivores, and suggests that herbivores may hamper pollinator-mediated adaptation in plants.									39	0	0	38	0	39			0029-8549			WOS:000228517300009	15678331J	"Gaston, Fco.

During two years we studied the effect of ungulate removal on the abundance, biomass, and diversity of arthropod families and beetle species. In general, our results have shown that ungulates significantly affected the arthropods living in the two studied shrub species. Ungulates affected arthropod community traits, this effect being evident mainly on arthropod and beetle diversity. However, we cannot draw conclusions about the positive or negative effect of browsing in our study area, because at each taxonomic level (arthropod families vs. beetle species) arthropods responded to ungulates in a different way. In addition, the effect of ungulates on arthropods and beetles differed between sites, years and sampling periods. Moreover, there were also complex responses of arthropods at family and species levels in relation to temporal variability, pointing out the necessity of conducting long-term studies to accurately determine the actual effect of grazing on arthropod communities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1130-4251			ZOOREC:ZOOR14212075472	J	"Perez-Contreras, J.; Garzon Gutierrez, J.; Garcia, I.; Tamayo, A."

A map showing the heights at which these Tortonian marine rocks are situated has a clear correlation with the present relief, indicating that today's relief has been formed since the Tortonian. There is also a good correlation between present relief and the Bouguer anomaly distribution in the Betic Cordillera, as well as with crustal thickness. Likewise, the present relief is directly related to the geodynamic setting of a horizontal N-S to NNW-SSE compression and an almost perpendicular extension, along with isostatic readjustment, existing in the Betic Cordillera from the Tortonian. As a result of these regional stresses, faults and folds hav e produced notable vertical movements. The highest rates of uplift of the Betic Cordillera coincide with large antiforms, in particular those of the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Filabres. Several subsiding sectors also exist (for example, the Granada Basin or the Guadalquivir Basin). The foreland Guadalquivir Basin has a complex history because the uplift in its eastern sector and subsidence in the western sector coexisted during the late Tortonian. Today the whole Betic Cordillera is characterized by differential regional uplift, even in the aforementioned subsiding sectors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Egg batches of the pine processionary moth were placed on four groups of Scots pines that underwent different periods of herbivory. The larval survival was related to the nitrogen content, fibre, phenolics and terpenes in the needles. Larval survival was higher in undefoliated pines, lower in pines defoliated two consecutive years, and intermediate in pines defoliated only one year, suggesting a direct relationship between previous defoliation and larval survival. In contrast, none of the characteristics of the needles showed a clear relationship with larval survival. The resulting reduction in larval number also affects the capacity of the larvae to develop during winter, because it hampered nest warming. Thus, previous defoliation limits, although it does not impede, the possibility of repeated defoliation on Scots pine. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Vertigo acheila Servain, 1880 is a synonym of V. pygmaea and not of V. alpestris or V. moulinsiana as previously supposed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0019			WOS:000226513400011	J	"Rodriguez-Rodriguez, M; Moreno-Ostos, E; De Vicente, I; Cruz-Pizarro, L; Da Silva, SLR"				"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /H-5318-2015; "	"Cruz-Pizarro, Luis /0000-0003-0687-0704; Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Rodriguez Rodriguez, Miguel/0000-0002-9949-1465"			Thermal structure and energy budget in a small high mountain lake: La Caldera, Sierra Nevada, Spain								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				38	5			879	894					Dec-04	2004	This work examines the diel change of energy storage and its associated patterns of thermal stratification during the ice-free period in a high mountain lake (La Caldera Lake, Sierra Nevada, Spain), in response to meteorological conditions. Bihourly data have been implemented to a standard methodology of surface heat exchange calculations in lakes. Strong variations have been observed on the diverse components of the energy budget at different time scales, ranging from diel to seasonal. Additionally, time-series analyses have been applied to reveal the underlying periodicities involved in relation to the different variables studied. The results obtained from this study provided realistic conditions for the environmental modelling of such processes, which are very sensitive in time scale.									10	1	0	9	0	11			0028-8330			WOS:000226772400013	J	"Utrillas, MP; Canada, J; Tamayo, J; Martinez-Lozano, JA"				"MARTINEZ-LOZANO, JOSE ANTONIO/B-6986-2015; Utrillas, Maria Pilar/B-5099-2015"	"MARTINEZ-LOZANO, JOSE ANTONIO/0000-0002-5158-5112; Utrillas, Maria Pilar/0000-0002-1952-4117"			Column integrated aerosol optical properties in the free troposphere: Case study - Sierra Nevada, Spain								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING				42	10			2268	2276		10.1109/TGRS.2004.833781			Oct-04	2004	From spectral solar irradiance extinction measurements in the visible range carried out at Sierra Nevada (2950 in a.s.l.) during July 1998 the characteristics of the aerosol column in the free troposphere have been measured. The results show that in stable atmospheric conditions, the column-integrated aerosol takes an optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm of 0.02 +/- 0.02, and an average radius in the accumulation mode of 0.15 mum, with a likely Atlantic origin. In unstable situations, the AOD at 500 nm can increase by more than an order of magnitude, and the aerosols' origin is uncertain, since air masses can arrive from different sources at different altitudes.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0196-2892			WOS:000224602600026	J	"Rams, S; Ros, RM; Werner, O; Shaw, AJ"				"ROS, ROSA /J-9780-2014; WERNER, OLAF/K-2374-2014; Rams Sanchez, Susana/K-2424-2014"	"ROS, ROSA /0000-0003-2115-2911; WERNER, OLAF/0000-0003-0601-3964; Rams Sanchez, Susana/0000-0002-6508-0860"			Pohlia bolanderi from Sierra Nevada, Spain, new to the European bryophyte flora								BRYOLOGIST				107	3			312	315		"10.1639/0007-2745(2004)107[0312:PBFSNS]2.0.CO;2"			FAL 2004	2004	Pohlia bolanderi (Lesq.)

However, shrubs can facilitate the establishment of understory seedlings in environments that, like Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are characterized by harsh environmental conditions. In 1997, an experiment was set up in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southeast Spain) to test the use of shrubs as nurse plants for an alternative reforestation technique. Two-year-old seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra were planted in four microhabitats: (1) open interspaces without vegetation (which is the usual method employed in reforestation programs), (2) under individuals of the shrub Salvia lavandulifolia, (3) under the north side of spiny shrubs, and (4) under the south side of spiny shrubs. Seedlings were also distributed in plots with and without ungulates to test the effect of herbivore damage. We report here the results of survival and growth after four growing seasons, a time span long enough to draw robust conclusions concerning the suitability of this technique. Pine survival was remarkably higher when planted under individuals of S. lavandulifolia as compared with open areas (2.6 times for P. sylvestris and 1.8 for P. nigra). The survival of both pine species was also higher when planted on the north side of spiny shrubs, while mortality on the south side was similar to that found in open areas. The reduction of solar radiation by the canopy of shrubs was likely the main factor determining shrub facilitation. The growth of the pines differed among years. However, growth was not inhibited when planted with shrubs as compared with open areas in any of the years. Herbivore damage was low but was mostly concentrated in the leader shoot, exacerbating the deleterious effect of ungulate herbivores on pine growth. We conclude that the use of shrubs as nurse plants for reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success of reforestation in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and that it might be similarly useful in other water-stressed environments. In addition, this technique offers the advantage of following natural succession, thus minimizing the impact in the community.									96	3	0	84	4	100			1061-2971			WOS:000223534700006	J	"Gomez-Aparicio, L; Zamora, R; Gomez, JM; Hodar, JA; Castro, J; Baraza, E"				"Castro, Jorge/M-1509-2014; Baraza, Elena/H-2546-2015"	"Castro, Jorge/0000-0002-6362-2240; Baraza, Elena/0000-0002-2928-3978"			Applying plant facilitation to forest restoration: A meta-analysis of the use of shrubs as nurse plants								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				14	4			1128	1138		10.1890/03-5084			Aug-04	2004	"After a millenarian history of overexploitation, most forests in the Mediterranean Basin have disappeared, leaving many degraded landscapes that have been recolonized by early successional shrub-dominated communities. Common reforestation techniques treat these shrubs as competitors against newly planted tree seedlings; thus shrubs are cleared before tree plantation. However, empirical studies and theory governing plant-plant interactions suggest that, in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs can have a net positive effect on recruitment of other species. Between 1997 and 2001, we carried out experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area (southeast Spain) with the aim of comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas (the current reforestation technique) with seedlings planted under the canopy of preexisting shrub species. Over 18000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area. We sought to explore variation in the sign and magnitude of interactions along spatial gradients defined by altitude and aspect. In the present work, we report the results of a meta-analysis conducted with seedling survival and growth data for the first summer following planting, the most critical period for reforestation success in Mediterranean areas. The facilitative effect was consistent in all environmental situations explored (grand mean effect size d(+) = 0.89 for survival and 0.27 for growth). However, there were differences in the magnitude of the interaction, depending on the seedling species planted as well as the nurse shrub species involved. Additionally, nurse shrubs had a stronger facilitative effect on seedling survival and growth at low attitudes and sunny, drier slopes than at high altitudes or shady, wetter slopes. Facilitation in the dry years proved higher than in the one wet year. Our results show that pioneer shrubs facilitate the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species and thus can positively affect reforestation success in many different ecological settings."									328	10	0	305	10	348			1051-0761			WOS:000223156600015	J	"Orozco, M; Alvarez-Valero, AM; Alonso-Chaves, FM; Platt, JP"				Alvarez-Valero, Antonio M./B-2732-2015	Alvarez-Valero, Antonio M./0000-0001-9707-0168			Internal structure of a collapsed terrain The Lujar syncline and its significance for the fold- and sheet-structure of the Alboran Domain (Betic Cordilleras, Spain)								TECTONOPHYSICS				385	01-Apr			85	104		10.1016/j.tecto.2004.04.025			JUL 19 2004	2004	Detailed structural analysis of the Sierra de Lujar in the western Alpujarras region (Betic Cordilleras, S Spain), a very representative area of the terrain known as the Alboran Domain, has revealed the existence of a very large N-vergent recumbent syncline which involves the whole mountain massif and neighbouring areas. The Lujar syncline and, probably, the associated recumbent anticline which crops out southeast of Sierra de Lujar show a great variation in the orientation of the hinge line. Although having a curved shape, the hinge line is contained in a plane whose attitude coincides with the main attitude of the axial-plane crenulation foliation (Sc), suggesting that it is a sheath fold.The strongly deformed overturned limb of the syncline is cut by two low-angle normal faults displacing towards the north. Similarity in the kinematics between the faults and the fold, and the association between the faults and the high-strain zone in the overturned limb of the fold, suggest that they are related. Regional constraints on the age of the crenulation cleavage and the low-angle normal faults indicate that they formed during the early Miocene late-orogenic extensional event in the Alboran Domain.We propose an alternate explanation for the structure of the Alpujarras region in which the Lujar syncline forms part of a recumbent syncline-anticline pair that extends along much of the Alpujarride outcrop in the southern Betic Cordillera. In several places, the fold is disrupted by low-angle normal faults, and it is overlain by an upper Alpujirride extensional sheet mainly composed of medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks. We suggest that all these structures arose from the extensional deformation under decreasing temperature conditions of a previously thickened and metamorphosed orogenic crust. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Hydroporus nivalis is found to be a senior synonym of H. foveolatus HEER but for matters of stability a proposal for precedence of the name Hydroporus foveolatus over the name Hydroporus nivalis has been submitted to the Commission of Zoological Nomenclature. Hydroporus sabaudus sierranevadensis ssp.n. is described from the Sierra Nevada, Southern Spain.

We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded from ungulates. In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of ungulates depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, ungulates also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, ungulates can still have a strong effect on arthropod communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between ungulates and arthropods differed depending on the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained for a group of insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities.									25	0	0	27	1	28			0960-3115			WOS:000188005900005	J	"Hodar, JA; Zamora, R"								Herbivory and climatic warming: a Mediterranean outbreaking caterpillar attacks a relict, boreal pine species								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				13	3			493	500		10.1023/B:BIOC.0000009495.95589.a7			Mar-04	2004	Climate change can harm many species by disrupting existing interactions or by favouring new ones. This study analyses the foreseeable consequences of climatic warming in the distribution and dynamics of a Mediterranean pest that causes severe defoliation, the pine processionary caterpillar Thaumetopoea pityocampa, and the effects upon the relict Andalusian Scots pine Pinus sylvestris nevadensis in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southeastern Spain). We correlated a set of regional data of infestation by T. pityocampa upon Scots pine, from a broad ecological gradient, with climatic data for the period 1991-2001, characterized by alternating warm and cold winters. Defoliation intensity shows a significant association with previous warm winters, implying that climatic warming will intensify the interaction between the pest and the Scots pine. The homogeneous structure of the afforested pine woodlands favours the outbreak capacity of the newcomer, promoting this new interaction between a Mediterranean caterpillar pest and a boreal tree at its southern distribution limit.									55	3	0	54	2	62			0960-3115			WOS:000187427000002	J	"Azanon, JM; Azor, A; Booth-Rea, G; Torcal, F"				"Booth-Rea, Guillermo/I-4504-2015; "	"Booth-Rea, Guillermo/0000-0003-1179-8321; Azanon, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-7834-5816"			Small-scale faulting, topographic steps and seismic ruptures in the Alhambra (Granada, southeast Spain)								JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE				19	3			219	227		10.1002/jqs.838			Mar-04	2004	The Alhambra (14th century AD) in Granada (southeast Spain) is built at the summit of a Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene conglomeratic formation. Tens of small-scale normal faults crop out along the northern hillslope of the Alhambra, which have a N130-N150degreesE strike, dipping 65-75degrees mostly to the southwest. These are closely spaced faults (approximately 5-30 m) with centimetre to several metre displacements. Several topographic steps in this area coincide with hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults with the same kinematics as the small-scale ones. Some of these faults appear to be active and related to the present seismicity detected in this region, and associated with the cracks and other damage observed in the Alhambra. Several focal mechanisms calculated in this study are in accordance with the dominant NW-SE orientated normal faults. We interpret that the topographic steps of these faults are a consequence of repeated earthquakes during the past 800 ka. The last large earthquake of approximately 5.1 magnitude in this area occurred in 1431, destroying the Alixares Palace, the Arabian fence and part of the Alhambra wall. We consider the seismic risk associated with these faults to be moderate, as the displacement is partitioned into several hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults.

Nos Oiseaux				51	1			1	10				No 475	Mars 2004	2004	Citril Finches in about 250 birds have been observed in mountains of southern Spain in January and February 2001. Birds frequented large reafforestations of Pinus sylvestris. 98 % occurred above 1900 m asl in the snow-covered Sierra de Los Filabres, Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza areas. They fed only on seeds of Pinus sylvestris an were not found in other mountainous regions as in Sierra d'Aitana (Alicante), Sierra Maria (Lorca), Sierra de las Nieves (Ronda), Sierra de Bermeja (Estepona) and the whole area of the Sierra de Cazorla up to Sierra de Segura (Granada), where Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra are the dominant coniferous trees, which offered this winter no seeds. Citril finches occurred often in groups of 10-60 birds mostly together with Carduelis carduelis and C. spinus, feeding and flying together. Citril Finches often chased away C. spinus and C. carduelis from cones. We suppose this behaviour may optimise food-uptake. Citril Finches could avoid to fly on cones without suitable seed quantity or quality. Birds feeding on Pinus sylvestris seeds are not forced to gain lower regions in case of heavy snowfalls as they do in France. That's probably why we have no no recaptures from this area and we will probably not have in future. Our observations make sense to the two captures in Ceuta (N-Morocco) up to now isolated. Spread to Europe after the last Ice Age probably started in southern Spain. If Serinus canicollis is the closest relative spread of the species leading to S. citrinella could start from N-Africa. Thus the hypothesis which considers the actual migration ways as a result of the former ways of spread, is supported. To explain the actual range historical reasons of spread may be more important than actual ecology.									2	0		3	0	3			0029-3725			ZOOREC:ZOOR14005032316	J	"Nieto Feliner, Gonzalo; Gutierrez Larena, Belen; Fuertes Aguilar, Javier"								Fine-scale geographical structure, intra-individual polymorphism and recombination in nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae).

In contrast, the one found in a previous survey in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae) for nuclear ribosomal ITS multi-copy regions was species-independent and has been hypothesized to be due to extensive gene-flow and biased concerted evolution. Since this was inferred from a genus-level phylogenetic analysis, the aim of this study was to check for the occurrence of such structure and the validity of the proposed model at a local scale, in a southern Spanish massif (Sierra Nevada), as well as to examine the evolutionary implications at the organism level. Methods: In addition to 117 sequences of direct PCR products from genomic DNA, 50 sequences of PCR products from cloned DNA were obtained to analyse cases of intragenomic polymorphisms for the ITS regions. Key Results: Sequence data confirm the occurrence of a species-independent structure at a local scale and reveal insights through the analysis of contact areas between different ITS copies (ribotypes). A comparison between cloned and direct sequences (a) confirms that, within these contact areas, ITS copies co-occur both in different individuals and within single genomes; and (b) reveals recombination between different copies. Conclusions: This study supports the utility of direct sequences for detecting intra-individual polymorphism and for partially inferring the ITS copies involved, given previous knowledge of the variability. The main evolutionary implication at the organism level is that gene-flow and concerted evolution shape the geographic structure of ITS variation."									15	0	0	15	0	15			0305-7364			BIOSIS:PREV200400229160	14707002J	"de Figueroa, JMT; Sanchez-Ortega, A"				Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/K-8143-2014	Tierno de Figueroa, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-1616-9815			Implications of imaginal-size over the flight period in stoneflies (Plecoptera)								ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE				40	1			37	40					JAN-MAR 2004	2004	In the present study, the decrease in the mean size of specimens over the species flight period in Plecoptera (12 species, 5 families) was analysed, revealing a significant decrease in the adult mean size, for both males and female, in almost all the species without an extended flight-period pattern. Some of the data show that, in addition to temperature, other regulatory factors must govern these variations. Data support the explanation previously proposed for other insect groups that the individuals with appropriate development emerge at the beginning of the flight period or slightly afterwards, when environmental conditions are suitable, whereas individuals with suboptimal size emerge later trying to increase in size but under pressure to emerge during a specific period of the year. Nevertheless, our data suggest that maximum size does not necessarily coincide with the peak flight period (maximum reproductive possibility).									4	0	0	4	0	4			0037-9271	2168-6351		WOS:000221835200004	J	"Martin-Garcia, JM; Aranda, V; Gamiz, E; Bech, J; Delgado, R"								Are Mediterranean mountains Entisols weakly developed?

They were situated at 1460 and 2000 m, derived from micaschists and quart zites under Mediterranean mountain climate conditions with mesic and cryic temperature regimes and xeric moisture regime.These Orthents are weakly developed, as shown by their reduced thickness, their lack of diagnostics subsurface horizons, sandy loam textures, skeletal, and lithochromic colors. Quartz is present in significant amounts, particularly in the fine light sand fraction.Analysis of the quartz grains of the fine light sand by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and backscattered electron images (BSE) revealed the presence of significant physical and chemical alteration features such as fractures, corrosion gulfs, fields of etch pits and dissolution of intergranular surfaces. This process is confirmed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) since the edges of the quartz grains have a higher proportion of cations other than Si, compared to their centre. Further evidence indicates the authigenic nature of the process. Starting from quartz etching an assessment of soil weathering has been made (W index from Marcelino et al. (1999).The alteration of the quartz, together with the development of a ultramicrofabric with several fabric units (investigated with SEM), and other characteristics (mineralogical, chemical, etc.) are considered indicative of some pedogenic evolution. These facts are especially interesting in the case of weakly developed Mediterranean mountain soils from Sierra Nevada, where processes of chemical weathering have traditionally not been considered very active.

Core rocks record a clockwise P-T-t path with segments of quasi-isothermal decompression that do not cross the melting solidi. Doming was caused by the interference of two orthogonal sets of Miocene-Pliocene, large-scale open folds (trending roughly E-W and N-S) that warp both WSW-directed extensional detachments and the footwall regional foliation. N-S folds were generated by a rolling hinge mechanism while E-W folds formed due to shortening perpendicular to the direction of extension. Strike-slip faults striking subparallel to the direction of extension laterally bound the domes, adjoining highly extended domains to less extended blocks.Using a three-dimensional model of the crustal structure of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome constrained by surface geological data, the relationships with present-day topography, and the deep crustal structure, this paper explores the role of crustal flow in the origin and evolution of the dome. Collectively, the crustal structure, the rheological considerations, and other geophysical data suggest the occurrence of flow channels at two levels: mid-crustal depths and the deep crust. Flow in the upper channel is closely related to the mode of footwall denudation by detachment unroofing. The flowing channel in the deep crust is probably induced by the NW-SE crustal thinning pattern inferred for the region, with a relatively thick crust at the NW, and is likely to be oblique to the direction of extension in the upper crust.A geometric model assuming footwall deformation by subvertical simple shear examines the possible exhumation paths of the lower-plate rocks and the evolution of the dome core in the upper crust during extension. In this model, the dome width measured parallel to the direction of extension can be used to estimate the amount of horizontal extension, once the dip of the non-readjusted segment of the detachment is well constrained. Finally, we also discuss two interesting associated problems common in extensional tectonics; namely, ( 1) what causes mountain uplift in recently extended continental terrains? and ( 2) what holds up high mountain belts in these regions where the Moho is often subhorizontal? A rolling hinge model and simultaneous transverse shortening can explain the high values of extension, the orthogonal folding, and the high mountains in the Sierra Nevada elongated dome. Flow beneath the dome of a relatively low-velocity, highly conductive, and probably low-density crustal material can support the high topography."									22	0	0	0	0	22			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2380-8	WOS:000271343400015	J	"Bello, C.L.; Alba-Tercedor, J."

Limnetica				23	03-Apr			361	370					2004	2004	The effect that a dam (the Canales dam), located in the upper part of a mountain river (Gerrit steam, Sierra Nevada, Spain), has on the macroinvertebrate community is analysed, especially over the larval diet of the predator caddisfly Rhyacophila nevada Zamora-Munoz, C. & Alba-Tercedor, 1992. To that end, sampling stations were established, upstream and downstream of the dam. Quantitative samplings of macroinvertebrates were realized every month. The macroinvertebrates were identified to the maximum taxonomical level (species level in the majority of cases). The highest specific diversity was found in the Chironomidae Diptera. The biomass per species was estimated, as well as the life cycles of the predator's species, mayflies and dipterans. Gut contents were analysed and quantified. The diversity of the MIB was determined by flow shifts and prey life cycles. Rhyacophila nevada is the most abundant predator, with a multivoltine life cycle, and behaving as an active searcher of preys, ingesting them from the caudal region. The number of prey items consumed by R. nevada increased with its size. Significant differences on the diet between the sampling stations are a consequence of the shift in the resource availability of preys in time. The trophic niche breadth was different among sites.									2	0		1	0	2			0213-8409			ZOOREC:ZOOR14108048497	B	"Gonzalez-Megias, Adela; Gomez, Jose Maria; Sanchez Pinero, Francisco"				Sanchez Pinero, Francisco/L-2629-2014		"Jolivet, P.; Santiago-Blay, J.A.; Schmitt, M."

Despite intense deformation, the occurrence of skarn-like lenses (epidote + amphibole + garnet + quartz) and abundant post-maginatic hydrothermal tourmaline in both the gneisses and adjacent metasedinients strongly suggests that an originally intrusive contact is preserved. High-pressure assemblages are not preserved in the dated gneisses due to intense retrograde overprinting during exhumation. Nevertheless, thermobarometry performed in adjacent skarn rocks and metapelites indicates maximum temperatures and pressures ranging from 605 +/- 74 to 715 +/- 72 degrees C and from 11.0 +/- 2.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.5 kbar. SHRIMP ion microprobe U-Pb analyses were performed on zircons from one gneiss. The zircon crystals display igneous oscillatory-zoned domains, with an age of 301 +/- 7 Ma (95% c.l.), rimmed by dark, unzoned overgrowths of metamorphic origin (mean age of 16.5 +/- 0.4 Ma). The former age is interpreted as dating the crystallisation of the granitic protolith of the gneiss. This implies a pre-Permian age for the Nevado-Filabride marbles, traditionally considered to be Triassic, and a Palaeozoic age for the complete sequence of the upper part of the Complex. Accordingly, in western Sierra Nevada, the observed succession from the Nevado-Filabride Complex to the Alpujarride Complex (Permo-Triassic phyllites and Triassic marbles) can be considered normal from a stratigraphic point of view. Therefore, the present-day contact between the two complexes, the Mecina Fault in Sierra Nevada, is interpreted as a normal fault generated during exhumation rather than a thrust structure.The age of the metamorphic zircon overgrowths (16.5 0.4 Ma) is likely to be related to decompression, as suggested by titanite inclusions found in zircon. Titanite postdates rutile, the high-pressure Ti-rich phase. This indicates exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride Complex significantly after the Alpujarride Complex (similar to 18 Ma).									17	0	0	1	0	17			0036-7699			WOS:000236955000005	J	"Fuertes, Esther; Acon, Margarita; Olivan, Gisela"								Sanionia (Bryopsida, amblystegiaceae) in the Iberian Peninsula.

Warnst. have been re-identified as Sanionia uncinata.S. uncinata is common in the high mountains of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Region of the northern and central part of the Iberian Peninsula in four differentiated areas: 1) Cordillera Cantabrica, 2) Pyrenees, 3) Sistema Central and 4) Sistema Iberico (from Sierra de La Demanda to el Maestrazgo), being rare in the south of Spain (Sierra Nevada). It occurs in mesophytic habitats with hyperhumide-humide ombroclimate (mean annual rainfall > 1.200 mm), preferring acid substrata; it grows on rocks, trunks, soils and grasslands around of subalpine-alpine lakes, with anthropogenic influence (Nardetea strictae communities). S. uncinata is proposed as rare species (R) in Portugal.A distribution map, iconography, spores and peristome SEM microphotographs are provided."									1	0		2	0	2			0211-9714			BIOSIS:PREV200600062238	J	"Puehringer, Franz; Poell, Norbert"								Notes on the biology of Synansphecia kautzi (REISSER, 1930) (Lepidoptera, Sesiidae).

Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien Serie B Botanik und Zoologie				105B				217	263					2003(2004)	2004	The six species assigned to the nigrita-group of Hydroporus CLAIRVILLE, 1806 are revised. Hydroporus sabaudus FAUVEL is established as a valid name for the species which has been treated as H. nivalis HEER. Hydroporus nivalis is found to be a senior synonym of H. foveolatus HEER but for matters of stability a proposal for precedence of the name Hydroporus foveolatus over the name Hydroporus nivalis has been submitted to the Commission of Zoological Nomenclature. Hydroporus sabaudus sierranevadensis ssp.n. is described from the Sierra Nevada, Southern Spain. Hydroporus tibetanus ZAITZEV, erroneously attributed to the nigrita-group till now, is transferred to the acutangulus-polaris species complex. Descriptions, distributional data, and some bionomical notes are presented. The great variability of the main characters of the species is discussed. A key to all species of the nigrita-group is presented which will allow the separation of most specimens. The body outlines and aedeagi of the studied species are figured to show the variability of body shape, coloration, and shape of median lobe. Lectotypes are designated for the following nominal species: Hydroporus nigrita (F., 1792), H. trivialis STEPHENS, 1828, H. glabellus THOMSON, 1867, H. subalpinus THOMSON, 1871, H. monilicornis J.SAHLBERG, 1875, H. bisbiguttatus J.
