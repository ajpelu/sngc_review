Populations of the snow algae Chlamydomonas sp., coloring the snow orange-red, were collected from Pico de Veleta, Spain, while snow samples from Mt. Neltner in the High Atlas mountains, contained resting spores of an orange-green colored Chloromonas sp. Other microbes observed in snow samples include bacteria, fungi, heterotrophic euglenids, diatoms, nematodes, and heterotrophic mastigotes (flagellated protists). This is the first report of snow algae from the Sierra Nevada mountains of Spain and from the Afro-alpine environment.

SUBJECTS, PATIENTS AND METHODS: Contact tracing of the driver, 3 teachers and 49 students from different grades who were travelling from Malaga to Sierra Nevada (Spain) in March 1998. All the students from the ten grades where any case of tuberculosis appeared from April to December 1998 and all the teachers of the school were included.; RESULTS: At the school, 232 students were studied. The prevalence of the infection was 35%. A total of 12 new cases among the students were found. No teachers out of the 127 examined became ill. Out of the people who travelled by school bus, 2 teachers and 19 students were infected, prevalence among students 46%; five of those become ill. The odds ratio of infection for those having a class mate with positive smears was 5,5. On the other hand, the trip by bus (compared with those who did not take it) meant a odds ratio of 3,4. Most of the infected travellers were sitting in the bus close to the index case.; CONCLUSIONS: In this tuberculosis outbreak some of the students who became ill or infected were not near the index case nor friendly with him at class. Therefore is possible that in some cases tuberculosis was transmitted inside the bus."	"PT: J; UT: MEDLINE:11222175"	 		 	 	 	Spain				 	0025-7753	 	Centro de Salud Palma-Palmilla.

The Science of the total environment	Sci.Total Environ.	2006	2006 Apr 1 (Epub 2005 Jun 28)	358	01-Mar	46	60	"Agriculture;Environmental Sciences & Ecology;Sociology;Plant Sciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;Toxicology (provided by Thomson Reuters)"	"Soil erosion, runoff and nutrient-loss patterns over a two-year period (1999-2000) were monitored in erosion plots on a mountainside with olive (Olea europaea cv. Picual) trees under three different types of soil management: (1) non-tillage with barley (Hordeum vulgare) strips of 4 m width (BS); (2) conventional tillage (CT); (3) non-tillage without plant strips (NT). The erosion plots, located in Lanjaron (Alpujarras) on the southern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in south-eastern Spain, had 30% slope at an altitude of 565 m and 192 m(2) (24x8 m) in area. The highest erosion and runoff values, ranging from 10.5 to 40.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and from 26.5 to 51.5 mm yr(-1), respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under NT. In CT, erosion ranged from 1.0 to 10.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 6.7 to 15.2 mm yr(-1), while under BS, erosion ranged from 1.7 to 2.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 19.6 to 20.0 mm yr(-1). It is concluded that the BS and CT reduced the soil erosion by 92% and 78%, with respect to the NT, and the runoff by 49% and 72%, respectively. The total NPK losses (sediments and runoff) from BS averaged 0.87, 0.07 and 0.72 kg ha(-1), from CT 1.82, 0.11 and 0.97 kg ha(-1) and from NT 3.15, 0.29 and 2.45 kg ha(-1), respectively. In addition, nutrient concentrations in the surface runoff were higher than the recommended level for standard water quality for N-NO(3), N-NH(4) and soluble P, particularly from NT and CT. These results support the recommendation of non-tillage with barley strips for sloped agricultural land in order to reduce erosion and pollution."

IMA fungus	 	2013	2013 Dec (Epub 2013 Nov 19)	4	2	243	249	"DNA phylogeny;Glomeromycota;biodiversity;conservation biology;systematic"	A new arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus was found in Sierra Nevada National Park of Andalucia (Southern Spain). It forms intraradical hyphae, vesicles and arbuscles, typical characteristics of Glomeromycetes. The spores are dark reddish brown to dark reddish black, 132-205 mum diam, and are formed on pigmented subtending hyphae whose pores are regularly closed by a thick septum at the spore base but without support of introverted wall thickening. Phylogenetic analyses on concatenate sequences of the partial SSU, ITS region and the partial LSU of the rDNA confirm the new species, described here as Septoglomus altomontanum, in a monophyletic clade next to S. africanum. An identification key to all Septoglomus species described is given. The new fungus can unequivocally be distinguished from all other Septoglomus species by the combination of spore size, colour and spore wall structure, and especially by the shape and colour of the subtending hyphae. Septoglomus altomontanum has so far been found only in soils with pH 5.9-6.7, located in mountainous and alpine altitudes (1800-3100 m asl) of Sierra Nevada which is well known for a high degree of plant endemism. While it is a frequent fungus in this area, it has so far not been found in lower altitudes in Andalucia.

PhytoKeys	 	2014	2014	 	35	1	15	"Liliopsida;Magnoliopsida;Sierra Nevada;Spain;floristic inventories;global-change monitoring;observation;occurrence;vascular plant"	The Sinfonevada database is a forest inventory that contains information on the forest ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). The Sinfonevada dataset contains more than 7,500 occurrence records belonging to 270 taxa (24 of these threatened) from floristic inventories of the Sinfonevada Forest inventory. Expert field workers collected the information. The whole dataset underwent a quality control by botanists with broad expertise in Sierra Nevada flora. This floristic inventory was created to gather useful information for the proper management of Pinus plantations in Sierra Nevada. This is the only dataset that shows a comprehensive view of the forest flora in Sierra Nevada. This is the reason why it is being used to assess the biodiversity in the very dense pine plantations on this massif. With this dataset, managers have improved their ability to decide where to apply forest treatments in order to avoid biodiversity loss. The dataset forms part of the Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (OBSNEV), a long-term research project designed to compile socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types in order to identify the impacts of global change in this area.

The drumming of Isoperla pallida Aubert and Guadalgenus franzi (Aubert) (Plecoptera, Perlodidae), and review and evolutionary considerations of Southern Iberian Peninsula Perlodidae.	Zoological Science	Zool.Sci.	2002	2002 Aug	19	8	871	875	"Behavioral Sciences;Genetics & Heredity;Zoology;Biophysics (provided by Thomson Reuters)"	The drumming calls of two perlodid species from Southern Spain (Sierra Morena, Jaen) are analyzed and described. Nineteen calls from one male of Guadalgenus franzi were recorded, showing a simple call pattern composed of two beats with an average duration between them of 184.32 msec (range: 165-227). This is the simplest call pattern yet discovered in the Plecoptera. The female of this species also presented a simple call consisting of only one beat. The male of Isoperla pallida showed an ancestral call pattern, more simple than the other Iberian Isoperla species (I. grammatica, I. nevada or I. curtata, all of them with multiphasic drumming calls or I. bipartita with a notably different model consisting of rubbing). Calls from six different males (the female did not drum) consisted of an average of 65.94 beats (range: 25-83) with a duration average of 1462.69 msec (range: 548-1835), regularly repeated with intervals with a duration average of 22.27 msec (range: 17-30). With this study, the vibrational calls of all the Perlodid species from the Southern Iberian Peninsula, except Perlodes microcephalus and Besdolus bicolor, are known. Moreover, it presents the first record and description of the call of the monospecific genus Guadalgenus. An evolutionary approach to the vibrational communication diversification in the perlodids of the Southern Iberian Peninsula is presented, showing a complexity graduation from the more simple drumming calls (shown by Hemimelaena flaviventris and G. franzi) to the rubbing call of I. bipartita and intermediate drumming calls of other Isoperla species, consistent with the drumming evolution paradigm of Stewart (2001).
