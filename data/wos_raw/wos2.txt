One particularly problematic example is that of wild ungulates which are increasingly being established in regions outside their natural distribution range due to human hunting interests. Unfortunately, we know little of the effects these large herbivores may have on the host ecosystems. This study deals with a first comparative analysis of the habitat requirements of two ungulate species that may be facing competition for resources in the south of Europe: the native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) and the exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). The aoudad is a North African caprid introduced in 1970 as a game species in south-eastern Spain. It has adapted well, and populations have been freely expanding since then. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis is used to describe the realized niche of both species where their distribution ranges merge. Both species occupy marginal areas of rugged terrain in the region. Marginality is higher for the Iberian ibex, which also presents a higher tolerance of secondary environmental gradients than the aoudad. Highly suitable areas for each species are secondarily suitable for the other. Reclassified and cross-tabulated habitat suitability maps showing the areas of potential spatial coexistence and differences in ecological traits between both species are provided. The results obtained do not allow inferring resource competition between these species. However, current aoudad expansion could result in it invading the favoured habitats of the ibex. Inadequate hunting policy and monitoring, and increasing climatic resemblance of the study region to the native aoudad areas, due to a strong desertification process, are facilitating a high rate of expansion. We strongly recommend to eradicate or, at least, monitor these exotic populations, and promote active conservation practices, if one wants to preserve the unique natural resources present in this European region.

Characterization of the satellite DNA Msat-160 from the species Chionomys nivalis (Rodentia, Arvicolinae)	Genetica	Genetica	2007	MAY	130	1	43	51	"Chionomys nivalis;Msat-160;pericentromeric heterochromatin;satellite DNA;Microtus;VOLE MICROTUS-CABRERAE;SEX-CHROMOSOMES;GONOSOMAL HETEROCHROMATIN;MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY;CONCERTED EVOLUTION;SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT;CHROTORRHINUS;AGRESTIS;HETEROGENEITY;AMPLIFICATION;Genetics & Heredity ER"	The satellite DNA Msat-160 has been previously characterized in several species of the genus Microtus. Here we present the characterization of Msat-160 from Chionomys nivalis, a species with a very primitive karyotype. As in other Microtus species analyzed, C. nivalis Msat-160 is AT rich, has a monomer length of 160 bp, is undermethylated and is mainly located in all the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome, but is completely absent from the Y chromosome. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that Msat-160 was initially distributed in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome. The taxonomic status of the genus Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus is a very interesting issue, so we constructed phylogenetic dendrograms using Msat-160 sequences from several Microtus species. Although the results were not informative about this issue, the presence of Msat-160 in C. nivalis and Microtus species suggested that both genera are closely related and that this satellite DNA was present in the common ancestor. Studies of Msat-160 in different arvicoline species could help to determine the origin of this satellite and, perhaps, to establish the phylogenetic relationships of some arvicoline groups.

From July to the end of September two Cimel CE-318 radiometers have been operated continuously, one at Andalusian Centre for Environmental Studies (CEAMA), located in the urban area of Granada, a non-industrialized medium size city (37.16 degrees N, 3.61 degrees W and 680 m a.m.s.l.), and the second one at the Astronomical Observatory of Sierra Nevada (37.06 degrees N, 3.38 degrees W and 2896 m a.m.s.l.), with a short horizontal separation between stations that allows us to consider both instrument located in approximately the same vertical column. The Cimel CE-318 measurements have been used to retrieve the aerosol columnar properties, including the columnar volume size distribution, volume scattering phase function, asymmetry factor and single scattering albedo, by means of appropriate inversion procedures. Additionally, at the CEAMA a Raman Lidar system based on a Nd:YAG laser source operating at 1064, 532 y 355 nm and including elastic, polarized and Raman shifted detection has been used to derive profiles of several atmospheric aerosol properties. In this paper we present analyses of the changes and temporal evolution detected in atmospheric aerosol vertical profile. Several long range transport episodes have been detected and back-trajectories analyses and synoptic information have been used in the discussion of results.	PT: S	 	Singh,UN Pappalardo,G.

In this alternance of cherty limestones and thin shaly beds, fusulinellid or anchicodiacean ('phylloid algae') wackestones-packstones and crinoidal rudstones-gramstones are the predominant microfacies, but chaetetid boundstones are conspicuous. These chaetetid occurrences of the Sierra Agua Verde are compared with the accumulations of Arizona, Texas, Kansas and Nevada (USA), and the Cantabric Cordillera (Spain). In Sonora, the environments with chaetetids were quiet, and located below wave base. Shallower facies with staffellids and Komia generally top the chaetetids. Because of the associated micritic deposits, the chaetetids have inhabited probably a soft or firm substrate. As a result of the disphotic-aphotic reconstructed environments, the possible symbionts of the chaetetids are more probably heterotrophic bacteria than autotrophic algae. The most comparable ecological conditions exist in the Atokan Marble Falls Formation of central Texas (USA). Chaetetids are not mentioned in the southern suspect terranes of Mexico, but were possibly present because these regions were located along the probable migration way to Peru, the southernmost area where Pennsylvanian chaetetids are known.

Perpendicular directions of extension in metamorphic domes and nearby sedimentary basins remain unexplained. This paper puts kinematic constraints on the final exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride complex, focusing on the formation of metamorphic domes and their relations with the adjacent basins. Structural fabrics and kinematic indicators below the main shear zones as well as their relations with both published changing metamorphic P-T conditions and geochronological data were studied. Our approach describes (1) a consistent top-to-the-west shear parallel to dome axes of during D2 (i.e., during decompression) with distributed ductile flow and the onset of strain localization along major shear zones, (2) further strain localization along the major shear zones under greenschist facies conditions, during D3 leading to S-C' mylonites formation accompanied with a rock strong thickness reduction, (3) the divergence of shear direction on either limbs of domes during D3 showing the appearance of the dome geometry, and (4) a local evolution toward N-S brittle extension (D4) in the upper plate and formation of sedimentary basins. Continuous ductile to brittle top-to-the-west shear is compatible with the slab retreat hypothesis from the Miocene; the formation of domes which adds gravitational forces responsible for the final stages of exhumation is thus characterized by important kinematics changes necessary to explain coeval N-S opened basins. Later, from the upper Tortonian, a contractional event (D5) amplified the earlier domal structures forming the present north vergent folds. Citation: Augier, R., L. Jolivet, and C.

This topographic depression is a plateau with an average elevation of 1000 m in the northern limb of the Sierra Nevada range. The continental deposits infilling the Guadix basin span time from the late Tortonian to the Pleistocene, when a laminar calcrete developed on fine-to coarse-grained fluvial and lacustrine deposits. The drainage pattern is strongly incised (up to 200 m) below the calcrete layer. Four coeval subsamples from the top laminae of the calcrete were collected and dated by the U/Th method. The resulting date is 42.6 +/- 5.6 ka, which indicates the minimum age for the cessation of active sedimentation in the Guadix basin. Using this age, we have calculated the incision and erosion rates for the late Pleistocene to present-day time span in the Arroyo de Gor, a highly incised canyon in the eastern border of the Guadix basin. The minimum incision rates in this canyon are around 4 mm/yr. We envisage the capture of the Pliocene-Pleistocene endorheic Guadix basin by the Guadalquivir River after 42 ka as the main factor triggering the formation of the present-day eroded landscape. After the capture, the combination of climatic (wet periods), lithological (soft and loose sediments), and topographic (high average altitude) features allowed the development of the present-day entrenched drainage pattern.

Small-scale faulting, topographic steps and seismic ruptures in the Alhambra (Granada, southeast Spain)	Journal of Quaternary Science	 	2004	MAR	19	3	219	227	"active tectonics;normal faults;co-seismic damage;Betic Cordillera;SIERRA-NEVADA;SE SPAIN;BASIN;MIOCENE;EARTHQUAKES;DEFORMATION;TECTONICS;BOUNDARY;MOTION;Geology;Paleontology ER"	The Alhambra (14th century AD) in Granada (southeast Spain) is built at the summit of a Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene conglomeratic formation. Tens of small-scale normal faults crop out along the northern hillslope of the Alhambra, which have a N130-N150degreesE strike, dipping 65-75degrees mostly to the southwest. These are closely spaced faults (approximately 5-30 m) with centimetre to several metre displacements. Several topographic steps in this area coincide with hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults with the same kinematics as the small-scale ones. Some of these faults appear to be active and related to the present seismicity detected in this region, and associated with the cracks and other damage observed in the Alhambra. Several focal mechanisms calculated in this study are in accordance with the dominant NW-SE orientated normal faults. We interpret that the topographic steps of these faults are a consequence of repeated earthquakes during the past 800 ka. The last large earthquake of approximately 5.1 magnitude in this area occurred in 1431, destroying the Alixares Palace, the Arabian fence and part of the Alhambra wall. We consider the seismic risk associated with these faults to be moderate, as the displacement is partitioned into several hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults.

The superposition of structures and the metamorphic evolution observed in the Alpujarride Complex, and in particular in the Adra unit, suggest that these events are as follows: (a) the first thickening event (D-1) results from continental subduction, and is evidenced by the presence of pre-S-2 high-pressure mineral relicts; (b) the thinning and associated vertical shortening event (D-2) is indicated by an almost isothermal decompression during which the S-2 main foliation developed; (c) kilometric-scale N-vergent recumbent folds of the condensed metamorphic sequences, and thrust and nappe-forming in the Alpujarride Complex, suggest that a second thickening event (D-3) took place; (d) the second thinning event (D-4), which affects the whole Alboran Domain, is evidenced by extensional fault systems resulting in the opening of the Alboran Sea. The oldest synrift deposits are of the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene, suggesting that D-1 to D-3 events are pre-Miocene; and (e) from the Late Tortonian to the Pliocene, the extensional systems were folded due to a continuous N-S to NW-SE compression.

P-T path modelling in different levels of an Alpujarride unit (the Salobrena tectonic unit) reveals a high-pressure metamorphic stage followed by subsequent decompression at nearly isothermal conditions. Nevertheless, the P-T conditions differ from one level to another. while the top of the Permo-Triassic metapelites includes carpholite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (10 kbar/425 degrees C), intermediate levels are characterized by Mg-rich chloritoid-Zn-rich staurolite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (minimum 10.5 kbar/450 degrees C) and the bottom of the Palaeozoic metapelite sequence presents gamet-kyanite-plagioclase-bearing assemblages (average conditions of 13 kbar/625 degrees C). Thus, the Salobrena tectonic unit represents an entire upper continental segment containing several crustal layers which underwent high-pressure metamorphism during Alpine continental subduction. The decompression, associated with an important mineral growth stage and the development of flat-lying regional foliation, reflects the thinning of this crustal segment, which resulted in parallel disposition of the bedding and metamorphic zones. At low-pressure conditions, large-scale folds affect the regional foliation, producing stratigraphic duplication, metamorphic inversions and the general reorganization of previous Alpujarride sheets. Finally, brittle Miocene extensional tectonics, coeval with the generation of the Alboran Basin, contributed to the definitive exhumation of the Alpujarride complex. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Field and regional constraints show that the emplacement of this large, composite, batholithic complex post-dates the main Variscan regional deformation phases (D-1 + D-2 + D-3) and associated metamorphic events. Field, petrographic and geochemical data suggest a strong genetic relationship between most of the members of the FAC. However, their Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic signatures appear to rule out any genetic process involving a single homogeneous source and/or closed-system fractional crystallization of the same parental magma. A model involving hybridization of mantle-derived basaltic liquids with crustal anatectic melts followed by further contamination and fractional crystallization is proposed to explain the isotopic and geochemical variation trends defined by the FAC granitic rocks.

It is a reflector antenna of 30-m diameter with a surface accuracy of 0.08 mm and a pointing accuracy of better than 2 arcsec. The telescope is equipped with sensitive receivers for the atmospheric windows between 0.8- and 7-mm wavelength. We describe the optics layout of the receiver and calibration system, which allows simultaneous observations at a number of frequencies. The special design aspects of the antenna, in particular the control of thermal deformations and the achievement of a high reflector and pointing accuracy are described. We compare the design computations with the characteristics of the telescope, derived from several years of operation and optimization. The success of the design is demonstrated by our observational experience. We conclude the paper with a short review of some of the astronomical results obtained with the telescope.

Moreover, the immediate proximity to certain plants can benefit other plants that grow below them, where toxicity or spines act as a physical barrier or concealment against herbivores. This paper presents the results of a multi-scale experiment performed to test the effect of shrubs as protectors of tree saplings against herbivores and the mechanism involved in Mediterranean ecosystems. We performed a factorial design in two mountain ranges, similar in physiognomy and vegetation, planting saplings of a palatable tree, the maple (Acer opalus subsp. granatense), and an unpalatable tree, the black pine (Pinus nigra), under three different types of shrubs. We considered four experimental microhabitats: highly palatable shrub (Amelanchier ovalis), palatable but spiny shrub (Crataegus monogyna or Prunus ramburii), unpalatable spiny shrub (Berberis vulgaris subsp. australis) and control (gaps of bare soil without shrubs). Three main factors were found to determine the probability of sapling attack: sapling palatability, experimental microhabitat and plot. Palatable saplings (maples) were browsed much more than unpalatable ones (pines). The degree of protection provided by the shrub proved greater as its palatability decreased with respect to sapling palatability, the unpalatable spiny shrub being the safest microhabitat for palatable saplings and bare soil for unpalatable ones. The differences found in number of attacked saplings between plots may be attributable to differences in herbivore pressure. The community context in which interaction takes place, namely the characteristics of the neighbours and the intensity of herbivore pressure, are determining factors for understanding and predicting the damage undergone by a target plant species. The mechanism that best explains these results is associational avoidance of saplings that grow near to unpalatable shrubs. It is necessary to introduce this neighbour effect in theoretical models and food-web approaches that analyse the plant-herbivore relationships, since it can strongly determine not only the intensity of the interaction, but also the spatial distribution and diversity of the plant community.

Daphnia pulicaria was the preferred substrate for the epibiont, whose life cycle was exclusively completed on this taxon. The density of epibiont dispersal stage and the epibiont prevalence and burden on crustacean zooplankton were directly related to D. pulicaria density in both years. Laboratory experiments showed that attached epibionts had a negative effect on Daphnia by increasing the weight and sinking rates of infected animals and a positive: effect by increasing its reproductive rates, with a neutral effect on survivorship. On the other hand, the epibiont dispersal stage was actively and intensively grazed by Daphnia, which implies a benefit for Daphnia and a cost for K. gracilipes. Thus, both species derived benefits and costs from this relationship. Our results indicate a positive cost-benefit balance for both epibiont and host in such a way that a mutualistic relationship can be suggested. This epibiont-host interaction may play an important role in population and community regulation in Rio Seco lake.

Ventral valves of the ovipositor were very short, appearing as two spurs; dorsal valves were longer but still shorter than normal. The specimen had an apparently normal testis on the left side and a well-developed ovary on the right side. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 2n = 28 + X0 chromosomes in the testis and 2n = 28 + XX in the ovary, the same as standard males and females, respectively, of this species. This suggests that the gynandromorphism occurred at a very early developmental stage. This gynandromorph could have originated from the formation of a binucleate egg by second-polar-body reactivation and Subsequent fertilization by two spermatozoa, one male- and the other female-determining; however, the most parsimonious explanation is the elimination of one X chromosome in a female-determined zygote (XX) at the first cleavage division."

The magma was anatectically generated, intruded almost free of restite, and evolved as a closed system by crystallization in situ. Geochemical modelling indicates that the lower and middle zones followed an equilibrium crystallization path, with no separation between solids and melt, and the upper zone followed a fractional crystallization path. Magmatic fractionation produced leucocratic differentiates with high P concentrations and a P/Ca ratio higher than in apatite. The excess P is located in plagioclase and K-feldspar. Monazite (+apatite) fractionation in the lower and middle zones produced extreme depletions in Th, U, Y, and the REEs, and chondrite-normalized REE patterns with low LREEs/HREEs and a slight discontinuity between Nd and Sm. About 90% of the Th, U, Y, and REEs reside in accessory minerals, especially in monazite. Biotite and muscovite have very low REE contents with small positive or no Eu anomalies. K-feldspar and plagioclase in both the lower and upper zones have moderate REE contents with positive Eu anomalies. Feldspars from the upper zone, in contrast, have negative Eu anomalies and have very low REE contents. Compared to available data from literature, D(Sr,Ba,Th,U,Y,REFs)bio/mineral are lower by one to three orders of magnitude, and D(REEs)plag/Kfsp are also lower by one order of magnitude. These huge discrepancies are attributed not only to contamination with REE-rich inclusions in mineral concentrates sed in previous studies, but to real differences in geochemical behavior of trace elements in peraluminous systems, with respect to subaluminous systems. Biotite/melt and, probably, K-feldspar/melt distribution coefficients for Th, U, Y, and the REEs in peraluminous magmas must be much lower than previously considered."

The influence of flow on streamwater concentrations and seasonal differences in quality and origin of dissolved organic matter, inferred from dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen ratios (DOC:DON ratios), were examined. During baseflow conditions, nitrate and ammonium had opposite behaviour, probably controlled by biological processes such as vegetation uptake and mineralization activity. DON concentrations did not have a seasonal trend. During storms, nitrate and DON increased by several times but discharge was not a good predictor of nutrient concentrations. DOC:DON ratios in streamwater were around 26, except during the months following drought when DOC:DON ratios ranged between 42 and 20 during baseflow and stormflow conditions, respectively. Annual N export during 2000-2001 was 70 kg km(-1) year(-1), of which 75% was delivered during stormflow. The relative contribution of nitrogen forms to the total annual export was 57, 35 and 8% as NO3-N, DON and NH4-N, respectively.

In a study of the endangered flora and its protection, 116 taxa are listed as having the most restricted distribution and as being under threat of extinction. Field work for these taxa was undertaken in order to improve knowledge of their habitats, populations, chorology and main threats. Using the new IUCN categories of threat, an analysis was made for each of the taxa, especially those that are critically endangered with a very low number of individuals or very narrow areas of occupancy. Mention is made of the problems posed by the practical application of the new IUCN categories. The main types of environmental impact affecting the flora are also described, including grazing, natural causes, wetland desiccation and water pollution. The highest-lying areas (oro- and cryoro-Mediterranean belts) are where most of the threatened plants are to be found. Since these same plants are mostly endemic to the Sierra Nevada, the need to protect the high peaks of the area is paramount. Reference is made to current legislation protecting threatened plants and the gaps in the European Union Habitats Directive with relevance to the protection of the Sierra Nevada flora. A number of key strategies for protection are proposed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The miginatites and schists suffered a coaxial-flattening event during isothermal decompression and were later exhumed by ductile ESE non-coaxial stretching. Further exhumation was achieved by W- to SW-transport brittle low-angle normal faulting, Subsequently these extensional structures were gently folded in the core of a NE/SW-oriented antiform during the Tortonian. Finally the Santi Petri domal geometry was accentuated by the interference of orthogonal high-angle faults with ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE orientation. This core-complex-like structure, formed by superposition of extensional and compressive tectonic events, does not represent a classical, purely extensional core complex, which shows that metamorphic structure and geometry are not decisive criteria to define a core-complex.

Although several studies have focused on the effect of exotic fishes on native amphibians breeding in ponds or lakes, little is known about their effects on stream-breeding species. We studied the effects of introductions of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) on the stream-breeding, endemic Iberian frog (Rana iberica) in a protected area in central Spain. We assessed occurrence patterns of tadpoles and salmonids and compared habitat use of the three species. We also determined experimentally whether chemical cues from salmonids elicited antipredator behavior in tadpoles. Finally, we assessed the relative influence of tadpole habitat preferences, differences in salmonid species, and invasion geography on tadpole occurrence. Despite widely overlapping habitat preferences, tadpoles and trout did not coexist, with the former restricted to fishless habitats. Tadpoles detected chemical cues from both trout species and reacted by decreasing their activity, although the response toward the native brown trout was stronger. The residual distribution of Iberian frogs in Penalara is better explained by the geography of fish invasions than by the fish species involved. Measures such as fish extirpation from certain areas, aimed at recovering lost habitat and improving connectivity among remaining populations of Iberian frogs, seem critical for the species' long-term survival in central Spain.

Study of a large number of specimens (males) has lead to solutions for most problems. M. servatum (Navas 1918), distributed in the NW parts of the Peninsula, M. cenerentola Schmid 1952, known from Central and NW Spain, and M. salardum Schmid 1952, from the Spanish Oriental Pyreneans, are all distinct species. M. gabusi Schmid 1952, described from the Sierra Nevada, was found to be a synonym of M. longulum McLachlan 1876, a species widely distributed (i.a.) in Spain. M. difficile Mosely 1933, described from the French Pyreneans, proves to be a synonym of M. vestitum Navas, 1918, the species being endemic for the Central and Western Pyreneans (France and Spain). A special problem is that of M. moestum (Hagen 1868): it is possible that under this name a pair of cryptic species is concealed, practically not distinguished by their genitalia, but with well distinct larvae.

Uplift amounts and average rates can be estimated using the current elevation of the outcrops of well-dated deposits indicative of ancient sea-level positions. Coral reefs and coastal conglomerates record the initial development of emergent Belie relief during the Langhian. Continental and marginal marine deposits indicate the existence of a large island centred on the present Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain by the end of the Middle Miocene. The precursor of the Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain, originally part of this large island, remained emerged whilst the surrounding areas were re-invaded by the sea during the early Tortonian. At the end of the Tortonian the inland basins (Granada and Guadix. basins) became continental, while the Sierras de la Contraviesa, Sierra de Gador and Sierra Alhamilla emerged, separating the Alboran Basin from the Alpujarra, Tabernas and Sorbas basins, which became narrow passages of the Mediterranean Sea. In contrast, the Sierra Cabrera emerged during the late Messinian, suggesting a progressive uplift from west to east of the sierras south of the Sierra Nevada- Sierra de los Filabres chain. During the Pliocene, only the low areas closest to the present-day coast remained as marine basins and progressively emerged throughout this stage. The highest average uplift rate recorded is 280 m/Ma for the Sierra de Gador, although the average uplift rates of upper-Neogene coastal marine rocks since depositon have maximum values of approximately 200 m/Ma. Most of the uplift of the Betic mountains took place before the early Pliocene. The recorded uplift of Neogene rocks was highest at the margins of western Sierra Nevada, where peaks higher than 3000 in occur. The average rates of uplift were lower to the east of this major relief. The main sierras and depressions in the present-day landscape correspond respectively to the emergent land, in which uplift was concentrated, and to the marine basins that existed before the final emergence of the region. The altitude of the sierras reflects the time at which they became emergent, the highest mountains being the first to rise above sea level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Its principal palaeogeographical characteristics are a large lake in the eastern sector, an axial fluvial system and two fluvial systems transverse to it in the western sector, The uplift of a central sector of the Betic Cordillera during the Upper Pleistocene affected the study area, causing northward tilting from the Internal Zone of the cordillera (Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza), step-faulting of the Plio-Pleistocene infill of the ancient basin (leaving more northern sectors in a lower topographical position), alteration of fluvial current profiles and displacement of the ancient Axial System to a position very close to the divide between the ancient endorheic Guadix Basin and the Guadalquivir Basin. This facilitated capture of the endorheic basin by the headward erosion of a tributary of the Guadalquivir River. The region then began to be rapidly eroded, as the new base level was now some 500m lower than that of the ancient basin. The present drainage network is similar to that of the ancient endorheic basin as regards the location of the main streams and the distribution of drainage patterns and fluvial styles, although flow reversal is found in some stretches and a barbed drainage pattern appears locally. As a result of the inheritance of drainage from the ancient basin, fluvial superimposition is found in some stretches of the main streams. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Three allocycles of tectonic origin were recognised across which there is a clear evolution from debris flow to sheet flow dominated fans, in connection with a decrease in the volume of fines available in the source areas. The larger volume of accommodation space created by higher tectonic subsidence in the northern sector favoured vertical accumulation of sediment, with the appearance of less elongated fans. In the rest of the system, where subsidence is less, more elongated fans appear, with the development of incised channels and irregular distribution of sediment in depositional lobes. This involves the appearance of markedly asymmetric transverse profiles, as well as lengthy recurrence between the sedimentation events on particular sectors of the fans, where headward-eroding gullies develop. The Lithology of the source area, where intensely fractured rocks are found, is responsible for an important sediment supply and a significant degree of clast sorting from the source area. Consequently, a weak longitudinal trend in particle size can be recognised, which influences the predominance of longitudinal constant-slope profiles and anomalous relations between both fan area and fan slope and their drainage areas. Recent intense tectonic activity has caused the appearance of abnormally low slopes in upper sectors of some catchments, where mass flows are trapped, and the fans present a subsequently higher proportion of sheet flows. Recent piracy phenomena can be recognised in some of the drainage basins, which indicate rejuvenation of the source area, in which case the fan presents a rapid increase in the proportion of mass flows with the development of a segmented longitudinal profile. Due to the recent nature of the processes, the morphometric relations in the fan fed by the basin affected by capture do not coincide with the other fans in the area. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

PCB, DDE, hexachlorobenzene and others) in lake sediments and fish have been studied as traces of atmospheric pollution. The Iberian peninsula lakes do not show severe anthropogenic acidification pH values are in the range of sensitive lakes, but the levels of acidic pollutants are low. The status of the organisms surveyed agreed with this diagnosis. Pyrenean lakes showed the highest fluxes of organic pollutants related to fossil fuel combustion, higher pollution-induced versus natural acidity ratios,and modeled alkalinity and pH declines.

In the north, the range of the C. c. cinclus and C. c. aquatictis subspecies overlapped. In the south only aquaticus was present and in the central mountains only cinclus. The biometrics of cinclus in the north and centre were similar but aquaticus was larger in the south than the north. Spanish populations of C. cinclus thus appear to go against the predictions of Bergmann's rule. The residual index (RI) was calculated for individual birds from the regression of mass/tarsus length. RI was higher in males than females in the northern populations, but the same in the centre and south. According to this index, males (but not females) were heavier than the theoretical weight in the north and lighter in the centre and southern ranges. Some other variations in the Spanish populations are also discussed.	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0001-6454	 	"European Univ Miguel Cervantes, E-47012 Valladolid, Spain.

At depth these data sets show evidence for a non-coincidence of the petrological and the seismic Moho beneath the Betics chain. The data sets reveal the geophysical properties of the Alboran domain (Internal Betics) and the Iberian Massif (External Betics). According to this, the Iberian crust features a relatively high seismic velocity, is seismically transparent in the seismic reflection images and is electrically resistive. The Alboran domain crust is characterized by a low average velocity, displays high reflectivity in the seismic reflection images and is electrically conductive. The outcrops of the metamorphic complex (Alpujarride and Nevado Filabride), showing relatively high velocities coupled with low V-p/V-s values (1.67) derived from the Wadati slopes, suggest the existence of rocks rich in silica beneath the Alboran domain crust. An interpreted detachment at 12 km depth imaged by deep seismic reflection suggests that these rocks could be related to the Iberian upper crust. partial melts and fluids are proposed to explain the high conductivity observed at deep crustal levels. These would account also for the reflectivity and the low V-p/V-s ratios mapped beneath the Alboran domain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An in situ experiment was carried out in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake (La Caldera) to quantify the specific release rates of ammonium and phosphorus in different phases of the seasonal succession of plankton. The zooplankton community was dominated by the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. 2. The rates of release of N and P (from non-detectable to 3.58 mu gN mg(-1) DW h(-1) and from 0.26 to 2.29 mu g P mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively) and the N : P released ratio (not detectable to 4.77) fell within the range typical of oligotrophic lakes dominated by copepodite assemblages. 3. The values of the zooplankton N : P ratio (5 : 1 to 10 : 1 by weight) were lower than those established for other species of calanoids, and followed a well-established pattern of seasonal variation from year to year with higher values after ice thaw and lower values as individual size increased (ontogenetic development). 4. The elemental composition of the zooplankton depended on individual size, while the released N : P ratio was inversely related to the N : P ratio of the food. This pattern conforms to the predictions of the homeostasis theory of Sterner (1990). 5. A feedback regulation was established between the stoichiometric composition of the zooplankton, their food and the released N : P ratio that can help explain changes in pelagic community structure during the ice-free period.

Values of the specific gross release rate (SGRR) fluctuated between 0.2 and 2.9 mu g P mg(-1) dry weight h(-1), and were higher when the nauplii of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus dominated the zooplankton community. The rate of P recycling by the zooplankton was high, reaching 1.6 mu g P l(-1) day(-1), and showed a highly consistent seasonal pattern from one year to the next, with maxima in midsummer. Zooplankton size accounted for as much as 85% of the variance obtained in the measurements of the specific rate of P release, while other factors, such as the quality or quantity of food, did not significantly influence the SGRR changes. Among the models tested, only the one proposed by Peters (Int. Ver. Theor. Angew. Limnol. Verh., 19, 273-279, 1975) was useful for predictions in this system. The stoichiometric model of Hessen and Andersen (Arch. Hydrobiol., 35, 111-120, 1992), applied in this oligotrophic system, adequately predicted the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, whereas the values of P release estimated using this model were far higher than the excretion rates obtained experimentally. These differences were related to the type of egestion (formation of faecal pellets) of metazooplankton and to the relative importance of the food resistance to digestion. We believe that in communities where copepods constitute a substantial percentage of the zooplankton, an evaluation of the P release which is readily available [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), total dissolved phosphate (TDP)] to algae and bacteria would not fit the predictions of general models of mass balance; under these circumstances, assimilation efficiency proves to be the key parameter for predicting the readily available P (excreted P)."

The seasonal succession of phytoplankton is characterized by a shift in dominance from eukaryotic species to prokaryotic cyanobacteria, as in a eutrophic lake. This unusual pattern for an oligotrophic lake is related to the release of zooplankton phosphorus, rather than to the amount of total phosphorus. The highest estimated values of this released phosphorus occur during the co-dominance of small-sized species and of one calanoid population, both under natural and experimental conditions. Our experimental results clearly reveal that a blue-green species replaces non-blue-green ones when environmental conditions render low or intermediate values for released phosphorus, irrespective of the grazing pressure. The absence of predators or high levels of released phosphorus stimulate non-blue-green growth. These results agree with the successional pattern observed for the algal assemblage under natural conditions. Nutrient recycling plays an essential role in the maintenance of the metabolism of the pelagic system, and therefore the prevalence of a top-down regulation mechanism as proposed for such low-nutrient environments should be reconsidered.

Data from a 24 hour sampling program have revealed zooplankton to show, as a whole, a definite nocturnal migration, comparable to that previously described (CRUZ-PIZARRO, 1978, 1981; CARRILLO et al., 1989). Within the phytoplankton, non-motile and close to neutrally buoyant species (mainly Cyanarcus sp.) showed a limited daily vertical movement remaining, for most of the cycle, at the upper/intermediate layers. These species were used as a reference against which to evaluate the vertical distribution of flagellates which, despite minor specific differences, exhibited a common pattern of migration (exemplified by that of Chromulina nevadensis) involving an evening upward movement and a return downward one after dawn, both roughly coinciding with the highest values of the relative rate of change in light. Zooplankton grazing might account for much of the observed day-night differences in biomass (and density) of motile algal species. Recruitments from narrow but unsampled water layers (such as the neuston) might also contribute to explain the unrealistic computed net growth rates for C. nevadensis in the early morning. Light is probably the stimulus for the algal movement. The possibility of exploiting rich nutrient micropatchiness generated by zooplankton excretion should be able to explain its adaptive value, as other major proposed hypotheses can be discounted in this particular environment."

Our results indicate large intraspecific variations in calanoid elemental composition. While mean N as dry weight increased from 3.0 +/- 1.3 in nauplii to 6.0 +/- 2.1 in copepodites, mean P content showed the opposite trend, varying intraspecifically from 0.98 +/- 0.26% in nauplii, to 0.87 +/- 0.21% In copepodites and 0.51 +/- 0.16% in adults. Thus, the mean N:P ratio increased ontogenetically from 3.3 in nauplii to 13.3 in copepodites and 24.6 in adults. Two ontogenetic parameters, the growth rate and body size, were associated with zooplankton stoichiometry. Among all II copepod stages, growth rate was positively related to %P and negatively related to %N and N:P ratio. A two-part analysis of these relationships, before and after metamorphosis, showed that the nauplii growth rate explained nearly all the variance in naupliar P content. A high P content in nauplii may reflect a high content of RNA, translating into rapid growth rates. Overall, these results tend to support the hypothesis linking specific growth rate with P content for copepods, but these results also suggest that the validity of this hypothesis is robustness when differences in the life history of copepods as a consequence of metamotphosis are accounted for. We suggest that the intra-stage variation in P content is associated with peaks of intensive metabolic activity during the process of molting in copepods, and we emphasize the importance of new empirical evidence to examine this hypothesis further.

The altitudinal distribution of the 99 most common species is shown and compared with those obtained in other European streams or rivers, especially in the Pyrenees. The general pattern of altitudinal zonation shows an increase in species richness from the headwaters ( 1000 m : 113 spp.) was not obtained.

This dam, with hypolimnetic release, displays short-term fluctuations of discharge and nutrient enrichment in the tailwater during the study period. Breakdown rates of the four leaf species studied do not differ between sites, despite the higher dissolved nutrient concentration in the tailwater. This lack of differences is attributed to the potentially high physical breakage of leaves during peak flows that are of higher magnitude at the upstream site. The invertebrate density in leaf bags does not differ between sites, and Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera are the numerically dominant taxa at both sites. With regard to functional feeding groups, the scarcity and lack of significant differences between sites for shredders do not match the trend predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept in relation to the effect of a headwater dam. Possibly, the discharge fluctuations at both sites causes excessive instability of the natural substrate (leaf litter) for the shredder guild. However, as expected, the biomass of collectors colonising leaf bags is significantly higher at the tailwater, which might be explained not in terms bf quantity, but as a consequence of the higher nutritional quality of the fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) accumulated in leaf bags at this site, owing to the eutrophication caused by the dam. Despite the scarcity of functional shredders at both sites, at the community level, the leaf material is significantly more ingested at the upstream site, suggesting the importance of this source of nutrition for the trophic web at this site in contrast with the tailwater, as predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept. This also suggests that caution is needed in using functional feeding groups as trophic guilds to infer system-level trophic dynamics in streams, given the prevalence of generalist feeders among benthic macroinvertebrates in these environments.

A rapid cooling stage can be identified from the high nucleation density and high n-values of minerals. A final stage of slow cooling, is identified by a low nucleation density and low n-values. At this stage a residual melt crystallized in thermal equilibrium to the cooling rate of the whole magma chamber. Thermal equilibrium and convection are necessary conditions for mixing. Enclaves can be interpreted as the remaining, non-disaggregated portions of an early injected mafic magma, which in turn underwent hybridization during injection. Their presence indicates the existence of magma mixing proceses and the possibility that the host granitoid was a hybrid rock.

In this study, we investigate the mechanisms blocking colonization by Pinus sylvestris of the meadows. Two experiments were conducted in which seeds were sown either at I cm depth or on the surface to simulate dispersal, and three treatments of vegetation removal were applied: Disturbed (where the herbaceous layer was eliminated, exposing the mineral soil), Clipped (vegetation cut at ground level) and Control (no disturbance of the herbaceous layer). In addition, the effect of seed predators was controlled by using wire cages in the case of the surface sown experiment. When seeds were sown at I cm depth, seedling emergence was not reduced by the herbaceous layer. In contrast, when seeds were surface sown and predators were excluded, the rate of emergence was low in the Control treatment, intermediate in Clipped and high in Disturbed. Seedling emergence was, however, minimal when predators were not excluded, irrespective of the disturbance level. Seedling survival and growth after three years of study were similar among treatments. The results show that the seed predation and the physical barrier created by the herbaceous layer are the two mechanisms blocking the encroachment of Pinus sylvestris onto these Mediterranean mountain meadows, limiting the regeneration and potential expansion of the forest.

Benefits of using shrubs as nurse plants for reforestation in Mediterranean mountains: A 4-year study	Restoration Ecology	Restor.Ecol.	2004	SEP	12	3	352	358	"facilitation;Mediterranean ecosystems;nurse plants;Pinus;silviculture;SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT;POSITIVE INTERACTIONS;QUERCUS-HUMILIS;SCOTS;PINE;NE SPAIN;REGENERATION;FOREST;GROWTH;AFFORESTATION;Environmental Sciences & Ecology ER"	Shrubs are commonly considered competitors of planted seedlings in reforestation programs. However, shrubs can facilitate the establishment of understory seedlings in environments that, like Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are characterized by harsh environmental conditions. In 1997, an experiment was set up in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southeast Spain) to test the use of shrubs as nurse plants for an alternative reforestation technique. Two-year-old seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra were planted in four microhabitats: (1) open interspaces without vegetation (which is the usual method employed in reforestation programs), (2) under individuals of the shrub Salvia lavandulifolia, (3) under the north side of spiny shrubs, and (4) under the south side of spiny shrubs. Seedlings were also distributed in plots with and without ungulates to test the effect of herbivore damage. We report here the results of survival and growth after four growing seasons, a time span long enough to draw robust conclusions concerning the suitability of this technique. Pine survival was remarkably higher when planted under individuals of S. lavandulifolia as compared with open areas (2.6 times for P. sylvestris and 1.8 for P. nigra). The survival of both pine species was also higher when planted on the north side of spiny shrubs, while mortality on the south side was similar to that found in open areas. The reduction of solar radiation by the canopy of shrubs was likely the main factor determining shrub facilitation. The growth of the pines differed among years. However, growth was not inhibited when planted with shrubs as compared with open areas in any of the years. Herbivore damage was low but was mostly concentrated in the leader shoot, exacerbating the deleterious effect of ungulate herbivores on pine growth. We conclude that the use of shrubs as nurse plants for reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success of reforestation in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and that it might be similarly useful in other water-stressed environments. In addition, this technique offers the advantage of following natural succession, thus minimizing the impact in the community.

Seedlings emerging early in the growing season often have a greater rate of survival or grow better if early emergence provides advantages with respect to an environmental cue. As a result, the benefits of early emergence may be lost if the environmental stress creating the differences among cohorts disappears. The experimental manipulation under field conditions of the factors that constitute the main sources of stress for seedling establishment is thus a straightforward method to evaluate the impact of date of emergence on seedling establishment under realistic conditions. Methods Two field experiments were performed to analyse the effect of emergence date on survival and first-year growth of Scots pine seedlings in natural mountain forests in south-east Spain. Two main environmental factors that determine seedling success in these mountains were considered: (1) microhabitat type (monitoring the effect of date of emergence in the three most common microhabitats where seedlings recruit); (2) summer drought (monitored by an irrigation treatment with control and watered sampling points). Key Results Overall, early emergence resulted in a higher probability of survival and better growth in the two experiments and across microhabitats. However, the reduction in summer drought did not diminish the differences observed among cohorts: all cohorts increased their survival and growth, but early cohorts still had a clear advantage. Conclusions Date of emergence determines establishment success of Pinus sylvestris seedlings, even if cohorts are separated by only a few days, irrespective of the intensity of summer drought. The experimental design, covering a gradient of light intensity and soil moisture that simulates conditions of the regeneration niche of Scots pine across its geographical range, allows the results to be extrapolated to other areas of the species. Date of emergence is thus likely to have a large impact on the demography of Scots pine across its geographical range."

This binary system has been observed during eight campaigns at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almeria, Spain)and at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain). 294 points distributed over the binary period and covering both eclipses are given. The comparison stars used to calculate the differential light curves (SAO 15242 and SAO 15251) were confirmed as being good reference stars with constant flux. These observations are part of a 6 year uvby and H beta monitoring program of low mass eclipsing binaries whose main objective is to provide accurate absolute astrophysical parameters for late-type main sequence stars. Details about the standardisation process and accuracy of the photometry are also given. The internal accuracy of the standard photometry measured as the mean RMS of the differences between standard and observed values for the standard stars observed along the program is only a few millimagnitudes. Detailed analysis of ZZ UMa, based on these light curves, will be published separately.	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0365-0138	 	"UNIV POLITECN MADRID,DEPT FIS APLICADA,EUIT IND,E-28012 MADRID,SPAIN.

It is operated and maintained by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA-CSIC) and contains two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5 and 0.9m and an Altazimuth telescope with an aperture of 0.6m. Given that the quality of the images and, indeed, the performance of the instruments are influenced by weather conditions, it would appear that the existence of a weather station capable of producing accurate descriptions is an essential component of any observatory. This is particularly true, however, in our case where, given the altitude, weather conditions at certain times of the year are especially harsh(1). For this reason, our observatory has required the installation of a robust weather station with easily replaceable sensors which can provide accurate and reliable measures of wind, temperature and humidity(2). At the same time, in order to avoid a complex topology of unmanageably long wires due to the distribution of a large number of sensors around the buildings, domes telescope mirrors and instruments, it has been necessary to implement a distributed system with several independent nodes connected to a CAN bus. This system is now in operation and running automatically at the OSN and provides all the data from sensors to the observatory control systems and to internet users. This paper gives a detailed description of the SNOWS project, including the development of the weather station, the software and hardware architecture, and the use of distributed nodes with a linear serial bus. The paper also provides some results regarding the wind, temperature and humidity sensors employed at the OSN.	PT: S	 	Lewis,H. Bridger,A.

Our study will focus on two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5m and 0.9m and an equatorial mount. The system currently installed to control these telescopes is a 1995 centralized VME module. However, given the problems which have arisen due to the number of wires and other complications, we have decided to change this control module. We will control each telescope with a distributed control philosophy, using a serial linear communication bus between independent nodes, although all system capabilities are accessible from a central unit anywhere and at any time via internet. We have divided the tasks and have one node for alpha control, another for delta control, one for the dome, one for the focus and the central unit to interface with a pc. The nodes for alpha, delta and the dome will be used by means of FPGA's in order to efficiently sample the encoders and the control algorithms, and to generate the output for the motors and the servo. The focus will have a microcontroller, and the system is easy to expand in the event of the inclusion of more nodes. After having studied several fieldbus systems, we have opted for the CAN bus, because of its reliability and broadcasting possibilities. In this way, all the important information will be on the bus, and every node will be able to access the information at any time. This document explains the new design made in the IAA for the new consoles of control whose basic characteristics are, the distributed control, the hardware simplify, the cable remove, the safety and maintenance improve and facilitating the observation improving the interface with the user, and finally to prepare the system for the remote observation.

In the Alboran domain of the central Betics, the present distribution of the Alpujarride units results from the extensional dismembering of a pre-Miocene nappe stack under brittle conditions. The interference of two subperpendicular and successive extensional fault systems can explain the current geometric pattern of the Alpujarride units: upper-Burdigalian-Langhian north-south extension was followed by west- to southwestward extension of Serravallian age. Northeast of Sierra Nevada, these two extensional systems have resulted in a spectacular chocolate tablet megastructure and the cropping out, at any one vertical sequence, of a varying number of extensional units belonging to the Alpujarride complex. This pattern can be considered representative of the middle Miocene tectonics of the entire Alboran domain in the Betics, and illustrates the development of rifting processes in the upper crust.

Source rock types of the Betic Cordillera include metamorphic (mainly phyllite, schist, quartzite, and gneiss), sedimentary (siliciclastic and carbonate), volcanic (felsic to intermediate pyroclasts), and mantle-derived (peridotite, gabbro, serpentinite, and serpentine schist) rocks. The fluvial systems range that transect the Betic Cordillera are the major detrital source of sediment along the southern Spanish coast, supplying sand to beaches and offshore depositional systems in the Alboran Sea basin. Three key sand petrofacies derived from the Betic mountain belt reflect the main elastic contribution of known source rocks. All the sands are quartzolithic, ranging from quartz-rich to lithic-rich. Fluvial systems draining the Sierra de Los Filabres, the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra de Gador, and the Malaga Mountains, and their related beaches constitute a metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic sand petrofacies (Qm34 +/- 10 F4 +/- 3 U62 +/- 9; Lm72 +/- 14 Lv2 +/- 4 Ls26 +/- 13), derived dominantly from the Nevado-Filabride, Alpujarride, and Malaguide complexes. This quartzolithic petrofacies extends from northeast of Almeria to Torremolinos (southwest of Malaga), and northeast of Algeciras. Only one beach sand sample, east of Cabo de Gata, is volcanolithic. Volcanic detritus (mainly having felsitic textures) is derived from Miocene (15-7 Ma) pyroclastic sequences cropping out in the southeast of the chain. This metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic petrofacies changes in the coastal stretch from Torremolinos to Marbella, where drainage systems cut across the Serrania de Ronda. Here source rock types include peridotite, gabbro, and serpentinite of the Ronda Peridotite Massif, and metamorphic rocks of the Malaguide and Alpujarride units. The fluvial and beach sands of this area are quartzolithic (Qm32 +/- 12 F10 +/- 3 U58 +/- 11), and include abundant peridotite and serpentinite grains. The latter quartzolithic petrofacies changes abruptly from Algeciras to Cadiz, where the sand becomes quartz-rich (Qm77 +/- 5 F4 +/- 2 U19 +/- 4). This sand petrofacies is derived predominantly from recycling of sedimentary sequences, mainly the quartzarenite turbidite units of the Gibraltar Arc (the Algeciras Flysch). This petrofacies is characterized by higher proportion of quartz grains and abundant sedimentary lithic fragments (Lm1 +/- 3 Lv1 +/- 1 Ls98 +/- 3). The three onshore petrofacies plot in the recycled-orogen provenance compositional field and the lithic to transitional to quartzose recycled subfields of Dickinson (1985). They vary from lithic, to transitional and quartzose depending on their source lithologies in the Betic foreland fold-thrust belt. These actualistic petrofacies best describe the nature and distribution of sand petrofacies derived from a collisional fold-thrust belt where primary and recycled source rocks are interfingered. Deep-marine turbidites of the Alboran Basin have basinwide quartzolithic sands having close compositional relations with Betic Cordillera onshore sand petrofacies. Comparison of detrital modes from mainland to deep-marine environments provides a suitable basis for interpreting the Miocene to Pleistocene sand dispersal history in the Alboran Basin. These modern quartzolithic petrofacies are used to interpret analogous ancient collisional sandstone petrofacies of the Alpine orogenic belt of the western-central Mediterranean region and of other collisional orogenic systems, as a broader point of view."

This species shows a nocturnal vertical migration and a simultaneous diel horizontal movement. In the present study, a detailed 24-h sampling program was carried out at four depths in six stations located along the two main transects of lake La Caldera. The results show the existence of diel cycles in oviposition of amictic and mictic (male and resting) eggs of this rotifer. The egg ratio for amictic and mictic eggs increases during the night. The oviposition of amictic eggs was also higher in the pelagic zone of the lake. Oviposition of amictic and mictic eggs was not related with density of H. bulgarica nor with density of competitors (Mixodiaptomus laciniatus). Our results suggest that UV radiation or an endogenous circadian rhythm of activity could be responsible of the diel cycle in oviposition of H. bulgarica.

A ratio of autotrophs to heterotrophs lower than 1 which lasted more than two thirds of the study period may suggest a high algal productivity per unit of biomass. The estimated strong top-down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton indicates an efficient utilization of resources. A comparative analysis between the available food supply and the critical food concentration that is necessary to maintain the population of Daphnia pulicaria (which constitutes up to 98 % of the heterotrophic biomass) proves this species to be food-limited in the lake under study. To explain the dominance (and development) of such large-bodied cladoceran population, we discuss the possibility of the utilization of naked protozoan ciliates (Oligotrichidae) as a complementary high quality food source, and the exploitation of benthic resources through a coupled daily migration behaviour.

Furthermore, the plate tectonics reconstructions (Weijermars, 1987; Dewey, 1988) and geodynamic models (Andrieux et al., 1989; Platt and Vissers, 1989) published so far for the Betic Chain have not considered these two episodes of thrusting recognized in all nappes belonging to the Alpujarride Complex of the Betic Chain. In the area studied, to the south of Sierra Nevada, the Adra Nappe shows a marked structural variation, from an upper folded zone consisting of low-grade metamorphic rocks, to a mylonitic zone located in lower levels and characterized by medium to high-grade metamorphic materials. It has been observed that the emplacement of the Adra Nappe has involved two episodes. The first episode produces the formation of mylonitic rocks with a stretching lincation N45-degrees-E. The second one gives rise to gouges and fault breccias, and is bound to movements of the upper block in N10-degrees-W direction. From a regional point of view, in this sector the Adra Nappe occupies the upper tectonic position of the Alpujarride Complex. The extensional regime of the Adra Nappe appears to be intimately associated with the N-S convergence of Africa and Iberia from Oligocene times, whereas the NE-thrusting would reflect a previous strike-slip motion parallel to the trend of the Betic Chain, probably in an oblique convergence setting. These points concerning the two directions of movement must be considered for geological palacoreconstructions of the Western Mediterranean area."

All species exhibited a positive protandry coefficient (range, 0.07-0.33), indicating that no species shows proteroginy. Protandry was less pronounced in species having extended flight periods, brief flight periods, or highly concentrated flight maximums. The degree of protandry did not correlated with the degree of sexual dimorphism in size, contradicting the theoretical prediction of increased dimorphism with increased protandry.

Nineteen calls from one male of Guadalgenus franzi were recorded, showing a simple call pattern composed of two beats with an average duration between them of 184.32 msec (range: 165-227). This is the simplest call pattern yet discovered in the Plecoptera. The female of this species also presented a simple call consisting of only one beat. The male of Isoperla pallida showed an ancestral call pattern, more simple than the other Iberian Isoperla species (I. grammatica, I. nevada or I. curtata, all of them with multiphasic drumming calls or I. bipartita with a notably different model consisting of rubbing). Calls from six different males (the female did not drum) consisted of an average of 65.94 beats (range: 25-83) with a duration average of 1462.69 msec (range: 548-1835), regularly repeated with intervals with a duration average of 22.27 msec (range: 17-30). With this study, the vibrational calls of all the Perlodid species from the Southern Iberian Peninsula, except Perlodes microcephalus and Besdolus bicolor, are known. Moreover, it presents the first record and description of the call of the monospecific genus Guadalgenus. An evolutionary approach to the vibrational communication diversification in the perlodids of the Southern Iberian Peninsula is presented, showing a complexity graduation from the more simple drumming calls (shown by Hemimelaena flaviventris and G. franzi) to the rubbing call of I, bipartita and intermediate drumming calls of other Isoperla species, consistent with the drumming evolution paradigm of Stewart (2001).

Some of the data show that, in addition to temperature, other regulatory factors must govern these variations. Data support the explanation previously proposed for other insect groups that the individuals with appropriate development emerge at the beginning of the flight period or slightly afterwards, when environmental conditions are suitable, whereas individuals with suboptimal size emerge later trying to increase in size but under pressure to emerge during a specific period of the year. Nevertheless, our data suggest that maximum size does not necessarily coincide with the peak flight period (maximum reproductive possibility).

After determining and quantifying the different components, we deduced that feeding is important among adults in this superfamily, and that the diet is varied, with cyanolichens and cyanophyceae being prominent, and hyphae and spores of Ascomycetes sometimes eaten, whereas pollen is amply consumed by some spring or spring-summer species.

The species of the families Chloroperlidae and Perlodidae fed during the adult stage, and the proportion of the different dietary components changed over the night period in relation to the availability of such components.

A map showing the heights at which these Tortonian marine rocks are situated has a clear correlation with the present relief, indicating that today's relief has been formed since the Tortonian. There is also a good correlation between present relief and the Bouguer anomaly distribution in the Betic Cordillera, as well as with crustal thickness. Likewise, the present relief is directly related to the geodynamic setting of a horizontal N-S to NNW-SSE compression and an almost perpendicular extension, along with isostatic readjustment, existing in the Betic Cordillera from the Tortonian. As a result of these regional stresses, faults and folds hav e produced notable vertical movements. The highest rates of uplift of the Betic Cordillera coincide with large antiforms, in particular those of the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Filabres. Several subsiding sectors also exist (for example, the Granada Basin or the Guadalquivir Basin). The foreland Guadalquivir Basin has a complex history because the uplift in its eastern sector and subsidence in the western sector coexisted during the late Tortonian. Today the whole Betic Cordillera is characterized by differential regional uplift, even in the aforementioned subsiding sectors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The significant uplift produced, over 3500 m, has caused considerable thinning, detachments and gravitational slides in the Alpujarride units. The general displacements of these movements are towards the WNW to SSW. On the whole, the morphology is fan-like, adapting itself to the border of the Sierra Nevada. This border contains normal conjugate NW-SE and N-S to NNE-SSW faults, the latter also with sinistral strike-slip character. These faults have accommodated the uplift of the Sierra Nevada within an almost N-S compressive context and linked E-W extension. This sector coincides with the western boundary of the Nevado-Filabride complex and, in its southern continuation, with the western limit of the lower Alpujarride units, seeming to indicate a fault (or faults) reaching deep into the basement. Uplift has taken place unevenly over the last few million years, with three noteworthy periods: during the deposition of the Block Formation in the Late Tortonian, towards the Early?-Middle Pleistocene, and in the Middle?-Late Pleistocene. This has resulted in considerable deepening of the fluvial net surrounding Sierra Nevada at the present time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This system allows the 19 movements of the instrument to run by using high-level software, a ""master"" board, and 19 ""slave"" boards. The Astrophysique Lineal et BIdimensional par REseaux Optiques (ALBIREO) spectrograph has three working modes and is installed in the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. We describe a low-cost system realized for the automatization of a multifunction spectrograph. It allows the control of a large number of motors: 19 for Albireo; the theoretical limit is 32 768! Another advantage of this architecture based on ""slave"" boards is to supply each motor with exactly the current it needs to reach the required torque (reliability and repetitivity of motions are obtained when the motor torque is at least twice the resistant torque). Thus, we can avoid unnecessary overheating which would be detrimental to the material as well as to the local image quality (seeing). The reliability of the system is obtained by software filtering the commands and also by using optocoupled electronics to avoid interference. For a complex instrument, the high-level software must be user friendly. The efficiency of the present software in this respect has been appreciated since first being used on the telescope. This system may be of interest to laboratories and observatories with similar needs for automation of motions. The adoption of this system will be supported by the IAA Laboratory, Granada, Spain.

When compared with unaffected reference soils, those of ski runs had substantial loss of organic carbon (-34%, -11.9 +/- 3.6 t ha(-1)) and micropore volume and size (-33%, -0.07 +/- 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3) and -48%, -1.62 +/- 0.28 mu m). Microstructure showed a dramatic reduction in organic cements and fungal hyphae. The organic content of soil seeded with grass significantly improved compared with soil not seeded or seeded unsuccessfully (P < 0.05), especially where the topsoil was reinstated. Organic C content, microporosity and soil respiration increased by 200% (+21 +/- 5 t ha(-1)), 70% (+0.07 +/- 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)) and 140% (+0.10 +/- 0.04 mg CO2 g(-1) day(-1)), respectively. Average micropore size in aggregates which in undisturbed soils was 3.40 +/- 0.28 mu m reverted to 3.52 +/- 0.36 mu m. However, the microstructure of the revegetated soils did not attain the levels of organic cements and fungal hyphae in the natural soils. Dolomite and salts were added to the soil to aid slope stabilization, fertility and de-icing of access tracks. As a consequence, there were increases in pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate equivalent and base saturation. The influence of management on soil properties was found to be greater than that of environmental factors.

This similarity is not related to restite unmixing, as indicated by the igneous textures of the enclaves. A number of other geological and geochemical lines of evidence, including the high REE and HFSE contents of the microgranular enclaves relative to the host granitoid, strongly suggest that this similarity cannot be explained by magma mixing. Alternatively, a crystallization process by rapid cooling within the host granitoid magma could explain the geochemical and textural characteristics of the microgranular enclaves, including shape, grain size, mineralogy, texture, chemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic composition. Such a crystallization occurred at the walls of the magma conduits through which the granitic magmas were emplaced in the upper crust. This process should be considered as an alternative hypothesis to magma mixing for the generation of some microgranular enclaves, especially where no direct evidence exists for the presence of basic magmas coeval with granitoids, and where there is a lack of isotopic contrast between hosts and enclaves. As the process is favoured by feeder-dyke related emplacement, we suggest that abundance of microgranular enclaves can be related to the mechanism of emplacement of granitoid bodies.

These rocks originated by mingling of a low-viscosity rhyolitic sill with unlithified, wet sediments. Highly amygdaloidal (up to 80% vol., millimeters to centimeters across) rhyolite globules extend from the upper contact of the sill for several centimeters into fine-grained volcaniclastic host rocks. The sill is very similar to other rhyolites in the IPB in terms of petrography and chemistry. It is aphyric to very sparsely quartz-phyric, with small quartz phenocrysts. Vesicularity has been measured in the sill as vesicle area fraction, determined by point counting over a rectangular grid, and number density per unit area, determined by counting every vesicle within the grid area. Amygdale distribution, measured within the sill, indicates a process by which vesicles migrated vertically from the lower portions of the sill to the roof zone. We suggest that this migration process caused local density changes, large enough to allow the rhyolitic magma to become buoyant enough to move through the overlying sediments, producing globular peperites. Globular structures are preserved when rhyolite globules entered the wet sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The land-use changes have occurred in response to rural depopulation and other factors since 1950 and have manifested themselves as a deintensification and sometimes abandonment of irrigated terraces which were extensively cropped as recently as the 1970s. The pattern of deintensification and consequential environmental impact is described for one municipio, Trevelez. Ecological changes have been consequent upon the intensity of grazing and the collapse of irrigation systems.

In the uplands of the Alpujarra, the traditional landscape most at risk is that of the irrigated cultivation terraces. These have often been established centuries ago and rely on water abstracted from streams draining the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The causes of this deintensification include labour shortages, which many Alpujarra municipios reporting population decreases of up to 50 per cent since 1950. Landsat Thematic Mapper digital data from May and August 1992 have been used to identify the various land cover components of the Alpujarra. Ground verification undertaken in September 1992 and April 1993 has confirmed that deintensification of terraced areas around the villages of Trevelez (at 1500 m, the highest village in Spain) and Portugos (1300 m) can be identified as either grassland or matorral. It is recognized that many classes of land cover are mosaics with several elements at a subpixel scale (e.g. terrace risers with fruit trees). However, the output from image processing has allowed areal estimates of the main land covers representing deintensification within the terraced zone. The pattern of deintensification of terraced land is fairly complex. It can be assumed that all terraces were irrigated and cropped at some stage. Land which is no longer cropped is usually grazed and the invasion of matorral species is common, particularly when irrigation ceases. Unirrigated tree crops and vines are sometimes planted on terraces no longer used for cropping. A model of deintensification of farming on terraced land in the Alpujarra is presented.

To investigate the possible effect of co-evolutionary pressures on cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles (the presumed nestmate recognition cues), we performed a comparative analysis of the CHC of R. minuchae and P. longiseta colonies from both the allopatric and sympatric populations; the latter includes samples of enslaved as well as free-living workers. Discriminant analyses based on these chemical profiles showed two clear profile groups: the first comprised R. minuchae and both enslaved and free-living P. longiseta from the sympatric population; and the second the allopatric P. longiseta workers. As expected, the profiles of the two sympatric P. longiseta groups (enslaved and free-living) were distinct; but, interestingly, those of the enslaved P. longiseta and its parasite R. minuchae were also distinguishable. This indicates that despite their cohabitation each species maintains its own chemical identity. Profile similarity between the sympatric free-living P. longiseta and its parasite may explain the lower than expected aggression observed during raids. We further speculate that in view of the differences between the sympatric and allopatric population of P. longiseta, co-evolutionary pressures have driven changes in the profile of the former to better match that of its parasite R. minuchae. Such an adjustment may have enabled nests of the sympatric P. longiseta to endure multiple raids by the parasite (due to the reduced aggression) and thus to continue to reproduce despite the damage inflicted by the raids."

A higher reproductive index, increased juvenil survival, less variable fluctuations in numbers were observed in the eastern Sierra Nevada. This can be correlated with the lower density (2 in km2) compared with the 11 km2 in the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura. This follows the predictions of large-mammal population models, which postulates that density-dependent food limitation occurs at densities near the ecological carrying capacity. In spite of the high adult male mortality usual in most ungulate populations, the sex ratio remained in balance most years in the areas studied. This was probably due to the lower rate of survival found among female young. A significant correlation was found in both the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura and the Sierra Nevada populations between the annual precipitation and kid production and survival of the young (from 6-18 mths), the correlation being closer where population densities were higher (Sierra de Cazorla y Segura population). The negative correlation observed between the spring/summer precipitation and the kid to female ratio during the rut period is probably due to perinatal mortality caused by the weather.

A population in the Cazorla and Segura mountains is rapidly declining, but the eastern Sierra Nevada population is growing. The stable population density obtained using estimated values of kid and adult survival (0.49 and 0.87, respectively) and with fecundity equal to 0.367 in the absence of density feedback is 12.7 or 16.82 individuals/km(2), based on a non-time-lagged and a time-lagged model, respectively. Given the maximum estimate of fecundity and an adult survival rate of 0.87, a kid survival rate of at least 0.41 is required to avoid extinction. At the minimum fecundity estimate, kid survival would have to exceed 0.52. Elasticities were used to estimate the influence of variation in life-cycle parameters on the intrinsic rate of increase. Adult survival is the most critical parameter, while fecundity and juvenile survival are less important. An increase in adult survival from 0.87 to 0.91 in the Cazorla and Segura mountains population would almost stabilize the population in the absence of stochastic variation, while the same increase in the Sierra Nevada population would yield population growth of 4-5% per annum. A reduction in adult survival to 0.83 results in population decline in both cases.

Despite the brevity of the active period (<4 mo), larvae complete their development in 1 season, entering winter as adults; consequently, the colony hibernates without brood. We studied the different phases of ovarian development and their relationship to the annual development of the brood as well as with abiotic conditions. The most striking finding is that after egg laying, the ovarioles recuperate slowly over the hibernation period at temperatures of nearly 1 degrees C, becoming fully developed ovaries capable of oviposition by the onset of the active period. We interpret this response as being an adaptation to a short active period as well as a compensation for the absence of a brood during the winter.

The main objectives of this field campaign were the study of the influence of elevation and atmospheric aerosols on measured UV radiation. In the first stage of the field campaign, a common calibration and intercomparison between Licor-1800 spectroradiometers and Cimel-318 Sun photometers was performed in order to assess the quality of the measurements from the whole campaign. The intercomparison of the Licor spectroradiometers showed, for both direct and global irradiances, that when the comparisons were restricted to the visible part of the spectrum the deviations were within the instruments' nominal accuracies which allows us to rely on these instruments for measuring physical properties of aerosols at the different measurement stations. A simultaneous calibration on AOD data was performed for the Cimel-318 Sun photometers. When a common calibration and methodology was applied, the deviation was lowered to much less than 0.01 for AOD. At the same time an intercomparison has been made between the AOD values given by the spectroradiometers and the Sun photometers, with deviations obtained from 0.01 to 0.03 for the AOD in the visible range, depending on the channel. In the UVA range, the AOD uncertainty was estimated to be around 0.02 and 0.05 for Cimel and Licor respectively. In general the experimental differences were in agreement with this uncertainty estimation. In the UVB range the AOD measurements should not be used due to maximum instrumental uncertainties.

The results indicate that this species has allometric monomorphism, the relationship between the head width and scape length being the closest to polymorphism. Three castes have been considered: major, minor and repletes. The latter caste, as opposed to the usual situation, has a morphological range not confined to the major workers. In light of our results, and those in the literature, we discuss the imprecision of the term ''caste'' when taking into account only the size of species with allometric monomorphism.

The average queen mating frequency (QMF) estimated from the sperm dissected from the spermathecae of 61 queens was 2.4 with 69% of the queens being multiply mated. QMF estimated from worker offspring in a subsample of eight monogynous colonies was 3.5, but the effective paternity (m(e,p)) was only 1.23. The difference between these values reflected unequal sperm use by the queens. Most colonies of R longiseta were polygynous and the average relatedness among workers was 0.35. Polyandry thus added only marginally to the genetic diversity of colonies, and our results gave little support to the genetic-variability hypothesis for explaining polyandry. Diploid male load was low, as only 1% of males were diploid. A large majority (92%) of nests produced one sex only, with males produced in colonies that had higher than average worker relatedness. This contradicted the predictions derived from worker control of sex ratios. Males produced enough sperm to fill the spermathecae of several queens. Thus, the results indicated that diploid male load, sperm limitation and sex ratio conflict are also unlikely explanations of polyandry. Plausible hypotheses for polyandry include mating by convenience, as the sex ratio is male biased and the mating costs to a female can be low because the females are wingless and have no mating flight. The observed unequal sperm use further-more points to sperm choice and sperm competition as important factors in the evolution of polyandry.

Four factors affecting the distribution of nests were analysed: nest density, intraspecific and interspecific competition, distribution and density of nest-site rocks, and the mode of nest founding. In general , P, longiseta shows a random distribution which is favoured by the distribution and high density of adequate nest sites, and by little or no intraspecific and interspecific competition for space. P. longiseta shows a rather stable interannual density in the study area, although there is some variation over the active period. Over-dispersion was found on only two occasions, coinciding with the highest nest density. The rocks are not a limited resource and their abundance and distribution have no effect on P. longiseta nest distribution. This species founds nests by budding, but this process appears to influence nest distribution only when plots are larger than 100 m(2).

An analysis has been made of the biotic and abiotic variables involved, the location of and conditions surrounding the activity, as well as the strategies used by the ant to remain active at high temperatures. The results of this study indicate that the maximum activity occurs during the middle hours of the day and that the variable which most influences daily activity is temperature, especially at the soil surface. With respect to the biotic variables, the availability of food and the demand for food by the larvae strongly correlate with activity. The time outside the nest is usually spent in vegetation searching for food. This activity continues even when the temperature of the soil surface exceeds 58 degrees C. To tolerate these temperatures, the ant not only has a high resistance to heat (critical thermal maximum = 51.1 degrees C), but also increases the speed of its movements and resorts to thermal refuges. The present work contributes data on the biology of this highly thermophilous species, which is also capable of tolerating a long, hard winter and then developing within a short vegetative period.

The evolution of this complex can help to determine both when the lower HP/LT complexes began to exhume and the behavior of the upper plate during this process. Moreover, this complex is a key element to understanding the relationships between the late orogenic extension in the internal Betic Cordillera and the coeval compression in the External Zones of the same mountain chain. This paper focuses in the geometry and kinematics of the Alpine structures of this Malaguide Complex in the eastern Betic Cordillera, near the village of Velez Rubio. We propose that these Alpine structures can be grouped into three main stages. First stage (Paleogene) began with a synmetamorphic slaty cleavage produced in anchizone conditions. This foliation is associated with northward vergent structures and was probably connected with the superposition of the Malaguide Complex over the Alpujarride during the middle Eocene. This first stage ended with the thinning of the Malaguide Complex (Oligocene) by an extensional detachment with a top-to-the-NNW sense of movement. Second stage records the convergence of the External and Internal Zones during the Aquitanian-Burdigalian. This convergence was a right-lateral transpression that produced back thrusts and extensional structures that exhumed the HP/LT rocks of the Alpujarride Complex. Third stage corresponds to the evolution from the late Burdigalian to the present-day, when the Internal and External zones were welded together.

The following species are recognized for the Spanish bryological flora: W. exannulata (Schimp.) Loeske, W. fluitans (Hedw.) Loeske and W. sarmentosa (Wahlenb.) Hedenas. W. exannulata is confirmed in Portugal and Andorra and W. fluitans is excluded from the checklist for Portugal and Balearic Islands. All specimens determined in Iberian herbaria as Drepanocladus aduncus var. asturicus (Renauld) Riehm., D. exannulatus subfo. falcifolius Moenk., D. exannulatus var. alpinus (Grav.) Wijk & Margad. and D. fluitans var. falcatus (C.E.O. Jensen) G. Roth, have been re-identified as Warnstorfia exannulata. Warnstorfia exannulata is common in the mountainous areas of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Regions of the northern and central part of the Iberian Peninsula, in three distinct areas: Pyrenees, Iberian-Atlantic Ranges (Galician-Portuguese Massif, Cantabrian Range, and Central Range), and Sierra Nevada (south Spain), although it is very rare in the latter. W. fluitans and W. sarmentosa are rare as both have higher moisture requirements than W. exannulata. Their distribution is limited to the mountains of the Eurosiberian Region of Spain, from the Cantabrian Range to the Pyrenees, where there is a strong Atlantic influence. The threats to Warnstorfia populations in the Iberian Peninsula are analyzed.	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	1290-0796	 	"Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Biol Vegetal 1, Fac Biol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.

Such granitoids have been the focus of special attention when studying the role of mantle-derived magmas in granitoid genesis. These studies conclude that basic magmas are involved in granitoid production but their contribution to the chemical composition of granitoids is often controversial. The Vivero massif (NW Spain) includes calc-alkaline granitoids and coeval ultramafic and mafic rocks, but these granitoids are syntectonic and intruded into middle-crustal levels during an early stage. Scattered major- and trace-element chemistry together with heterogeneous Sr-Nd isotopic results preclude an origin of this ultramafic-to-granitoid association by any closed-system fractionation process. Ultramafic rocks include peridotites, pyroxenites and hornblendites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.5 to -1.3 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)i ratio from 0.7059 to 0.7080. They are interpreted as cumulates formed by ''in situ'' fractional crystallization from contaminated basaltic magmas, particularly by interaction with Sr-87-enriched fluids. Mafic rocks comprise biotite-amphibole diorites, quartz diorites and tonalites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.8 to 0.0 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio from 0.7058 to 0.7073. They represent either cumulates or more evolved magmas of calc-alkaline affinity. These rocks display an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the degree of contamination inferred from isotope data. This points to wall-rock assimilation by thermal erosion during ascent of basic magmas up to the middle crust and supports the participation of mantle sources with positive epsilon Nd-i and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) < 0.7058. Granitoids range from amphibole-biotite tonalites, through biotite granodiorites to monzonitic granites. They show an isotopic trend which diverges from that of ultramafic and mafic rocks. epsilon Nd-i (-6.0 to -1.9) decreases while (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio (0.7061 to 0.7082) increases from tonalites to monzonitic granites, reflecting an increasing contribution of crustal components in more differentiated rocks. Assimilation and fractional crystallization, mixing included, account for such an evolution. Contamination of basic magmas by this process occurring at deeper crustal level produced hybrid tonalites and related matric magmatic enclaves. Only monzonitic granites are interpreted as pure crustal melts. Their HREE fractionated patterns [(Gd/Yb)(N) = 4-5] suggest equilibrium with a garnet-rich residuum. Partial melting of moderate time-integrated Rb/Sr protolith, such as greywackes and/or meta-igneous rocks of intermediate-acid composition, could account for the isotopic composition of these monzogranites. This example shows that at least some calc-alkaline granitoids of collisional settings are not produced by pure intra-crustal melting. They are formed through a complex, multi-stage hybridization process, involving mantle-derived magmas, crustal components and several concomitant magmatic processes.

The Sierra Nevada, Sierra Alhamilla, Sierra de Los Filabres, Sierra Tejeda and Sierra de Gador, among others, are roughly E-W trending high mountain ranges, corresponding to antiforms where metamorphic rocks crop out. The surrounding depressions are located in synforms, where Neogene rocks are preserved from erosion. Field evidence shows that the growth of the folds is coeval with fault development, and that at least three of them, i.e. the Padul Fault, the Zafarraya Fault, and the Balanegra Fault, may be considered to be active seismogenetic structures. The Zafarraya Fault, in particular, is thought to be responsible for the 1884 Andalucia Earthquake. The fault is located at the northern limb of the Sierra Tejeda antiform, and could be interpreted as a collapse structure developed along the external arch of the uplifted fold. The Padul and Balanegra faults are located at the southeastern border of the Granada Basin and south of the Sierra de Gador, respectively. They belong to a set of NW-SE oriented faults that are mainly normal in character and indicate NE-SW extension. The set up, since 1999, of a GPS network within and around the Granada Basin and the planed installation of a new network in the Sierra Tejeda, will give us new insights on the present-day deformation behaviour of both folds and faults in the area.

In the frame of the COST 625 action, four sectors have been studied in the central part of the cordillera. In the Granada Depression, the large NW-SE Padul normal fault deforms the SW periclinal end of the Sierra Nevada antiform. MT surveys indicate the continuity in depth of high and low angle normal seismogenic faults and the presence of active detachment faults. In Tabernas region a good example of interaction between a NW-SE propagating normal fault, E-W strike-slip faults and the fold system is studied. In the Sierra Tejeda-Zafarraya and in the Balanegra-Sierra de Gador areas, two new GPS networks have been installed to determine the interaction and the development of large antiformal structures and normal faults with E-W and NW-SE orientations. However, taking into account the low tectonic activity of the studied region, a period of more than 5 year could be needed to determine with enough accuracy the development rate of the structures.

Mountain ranges in the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordillera are exhumed massifs of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, and are surrounded by low-lying sedimentary basins. The Neogene history of mountain range uplift and basin formation in the Belies is well studied, but Quaternary topographic development and its relation to convergent plate boundary tectonics is less understood. Deformation, rates of stream incision and factors controlling landscape evolution on the flanks of the highest mountains in the Betic Cordillera are studied to gain insight on the relationship of Quaternary tectonics to topographic development. Specifically, geomorphic processes that led to formation of topographic relief within the Internal Zone of the Belie Cordillera are assessed. This paper is based on a field study conducted in the eastern Alpujarran Corridor (EAC), which is the eastern half of a 4-6 km wide and 80-km long inverted sedimentary basin. The Mid to Late Quaternary history of basin denudation is deduced on the basis of morphostratigraphic, geochronologic and structural-geologic analyses of oxygen isotope Stage 8-time fluvial deposits in the EAC. Results of these analyses indicate that climate and faulting played only a minor role in landscape evolution in the EAC. Instead, the EAC topographic trough was excavated by a drainage network whose axial stream (Rio Andarax) was incising at a rate between 0.3 and 0.7 m/ka since oxygen isotope Stage 8. This paper demonstrates that these incision rates are the same as regional rock uplift rates in the EAC. During the Mid and Late Quaternary, topographic relief between the EAC and adjacent mountain ranges developed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift. The implications of the results of this investigation are used to propose a model of Quaternary topographic relief development in the Internal Zone of Betic Cordillera. Topographic relief between Internal Zone bedrock massifs and adjacent basins formed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift. Faulting also played a significant role in areas that are within a few kilometers of crustal-scale fault zones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The size-abundance distribution was dominated by medium-sized phytoplankton cells (Gymnodinium cf. excavatum, Tetraselmis apiculata, Dunaliella spe. and several diatom species), large ciliates (Fabrea salina) and a few zooplankton species adapted to changing temporary environments within a wide size range (Cletocamptus retrogressus, Moina salina, Branchinella spinosa). This polymodal size distribution is compared with results obtained in other systems, including small physically controlled lakes, large lakes, oceans and marine benthos. Consideration of the size structure within homogeneous groups of organisms shows slopes less negative than the average for the whole size range analyzed, a feature which is common in small and physically controlled ecosystems. A seasonal study of the size structure revealed uneven distributions throughout the year, resulting in discontinuities in the size spectra as well as in differences of total size range. There were noticeable differences among the size spectra at each particular time, showing phases of primary producer predominance and phases with a marked predominance of consumers. The time-integrated size spectrum did not exhibit any distinct discontinuity. The influence of extreme shallowness and resuspension on the shape and dynamics of the size spectrum is examined and discussed compared to deeper aquatic systems.

The abundance of two insect species - a pulp-sucking scale and a seed-predator wasp - was surveyed with respect both to fruit characteristics and to viability of seeds contained therein. Seed-predator pressure was not significantly related to any fruit characteristics; however, pulp suckers tended to be more abundant in plants with low pulp:seed ratios and high fruit-water content. In addition, fruits with high levels of pulp-sucker attack tended to have higher water content. A multi-factor ANOVA, considering the identity of the plant and the attack of the different pests as factors, showed that plant identity accounts for most of the variation in fruit characteristics. The viability of seeds tended to be lower in plants strongly attacked by both pests. Fruits attacked by seed predators showed significantly lower proportions of viable and unviable seeds than did unattacked fruits. Seed viability was also lower in those fruits heavily attacked by pulp suckers, but this pattern is strongly mediated by plant identity. Pest activity proved to be clearly associated with a direct decrease in juniper reproductive capacity. This loss involved a reduction of the viable-seed number, mainly related to the seed predator, as well as a reduction of fruit attractiveness to frugivorous dispersers, related to the pulp sucker.

For two years, we performed field experiments to analyse fruit selection by birds, offering birds different types of anomalous fruits (unripe, aborted, pulp-sucker infested and seed-predator attacked) and comparing the removal rate to that of ripe, healthy, control fruits. In addition, ne studied the proportion of fruits attacked by the seed predator in samples of fruits which, after manipulation and rejection by birds, we found lying underneath plants. We compared these data to values in samples of fruits which we took directly From plants. Finally, over four years, the abundance of predispersal-depredated seeds in the seed rain dispersed by birds was compared with the abundance in seeds taken directly from plants. Fruit-choice experiments showed that unripe, aborted and Fruits attacked by pest insects (both pulp sucker and seed predator) were strongly counterselected by these frugivorous birds. The proportion of fruits attacked by seed-predator in the sample of fruits manipulated and rejected was significantly higher than in the fruits taken from plants. For all study years, the proportion of depredated seeds was significantly lower in the sample of seeds dispersed by birds than in the sample of seeds taken from plants. Bird response to pests was not categorically to accept or reject fruit, but rather was influenced by pest density. Birds showed two different levels of fruit selection, depending on the type of fruit: visual discrimination, against Fruits that are unripe, aborted and infested by the pulp sucker: and within-beak discrimination, against fruits attacked by the seed predator. In the study, both pests either died or left the fruit when ripe, and therefore frugivorous birds did not interfere directly with frugivorous insects. On the contrary, insects did interfere indirectly with birds, promoting the rejection of pest-attacked fruits by birds. Bird dispersers overcame the predispersal interference of pest fruit damage and Fruit abortion and increased the proportion of healthy seeds in the seed rain. This fact, together with the great quantity of seeds dispersed by birds, reinforces the importance of birds as plant mutualists.

For this, we compared the age structure of these Mediterranean populations with those of northern Spain (Atlantic), and, on a local scale, the populations of different habitats within the Sierra Nevada. The populations from northern Spain showed age structures with high proportions at young stages. In contrast, the Mediterranean populations proved to be dominated by adult and senescent individuals, except for the few habitats with higher water availability during the summer, which have larger proportions of seedlings and juveniles. Dry habitats showed a lower seedling survival rate than did wet ones, mainly due to summer drought. Both the difference between Atlantic and Mediterranean categories, and the difference between habitats in Sierra Nevada reflect a serious limitation on recruitment of J. communis in Mediterranean mountains due to climatic stress imposed by summer drought. The Mediterranean populations provide a clear example of remnant dynamics, surviving for long periods due to great individual longevity which partially offsets losses to unfavourable environmental conditions. The low ability to recover after anthropic disturbances emphasizes the need for conservation of J. communis populations in southeastern Spain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we study the effects of herbivory and the protective role of woody shrubs in the regeneration ability of the yew in the Sierra Nevada. The estimated density of the yew in the study plot was 287.9 individuals/ha, more than 90% being juveniles (seedlings and saplings), which were mostly located under fleshy-fruited shrubs. Saplings suffered serious herbivore damage when unprotected by shrubs. Thus, fleshy-fruited shrubs proved to be the best habitat fur seedling establishment and sapling survival and growth. The abundance of fleshy-fruited shrubs in our study site provides a yew population characterized by an active regeneration under natural conditions. We suggest that the maintenance of healthy populations of yew in Mediterranean mountains is strongly dependent on the conservation of well-developed fleshy-fruit understories and their community of avian dispersers.

The present day extension is accommodated by normal faults with various orientations but particularly with a NW-SE strike. At the surface, these active NW-SE normal faults are mainly concentrated on the NE part of the Basin. In this part we have selected a 15-km long segment where several active normal faults crop out. Using the marine Tortonian rocks as a reference, we have calculated a minimum extensional rate of 0.15-0.30 mm/year. The observed block rotation, the listric geometry of faults at depth and the distribution of seismicity over the whole Basin, indicate that this rate is a minimum value. In the framework of an interdisciplinary research project a non-permanent GPS-network has been established in the central sector of Betic Cordillera to monitor the crustal deformations. The first two observation campaigns were done in 1999 and 2000.	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0039-3169	 	"Univ Jaen, EPS, Dept Ing Cartog Geodesica & Fotogrametria, Jaen 2371, Spain.

The glacier gradually retreated during the last century, leaving a large talus slope at the base of the wall. The unconsolidated material covering the ice masses acted as a thermal insulator. Recent bottom temperature of snow (BTS) analyses and drillings indicate that the ice still exists within the talus. Evidence from field observations made during the period 1995-2001. revealed that large mass movements occurred during the driest summers ( 1998 and especially. 1999 and 2000) when the talus was snow free. These conditions suggest a direct relationship between talus stability and thermal insulation from the snow cover in areas where buried ice or decaying marginal permafrost exists.

However, little empirical information exists on the real effect that these organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year) ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E. baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was nonsignificant, although > 50% of Erysimum seedlings died due to ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species. Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat distribution and niche structure."

The abundance and diversity of the pollinator assemblage of plants excluded from and exposed to mammalian herbivores, and the combined effect of pollinators and herbivores on plant reproduction were determined over a period of 2 years. Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from herbivores. Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and herbivores affected plant fitness, but their effects were not independent. Herbivores only had a detrimental effect on plant fitness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced fitness only when herbivores were excluded. This outcome demonstrates that the importance of pollinators for plant fitness depends on the occurrence of herbivores, and suggests that herbivores may hamper pollinator-mediated adaptation in plants.

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found significant selection on flower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the flowers. When ungulates were present, selection on floral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on flower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and floral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conflicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination. An accurate picture of the pollinator role as selective pressure requires the consideration of the entire life cycle of the plant as well as the ecological scenario in which the interactions occur."

The flowers of this plant species were visited by very few insects belonging only to two generalist taxa, thrips and ants. Nevertheless, reproduction is not pollen limited in E. willkommii. Hand-pollinations demonstrated that this plant species is capable of selfing, reproductive success being similar in autogamous and allogamous crosses. Moreover, pollinator-exclusion experiments also showed that, under natural conditions, this plant relies predominantly on selfing, seed production being similar in presence or absence of pollinators. Selfing in E. willkommii is presumably an ecological mechanism to ensure successful reproduction in a harsh environment where pollinator availability is extremely low.

I studied the spatial pattern of Cuscuta infestation in H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada, Spain, for 6 years (1988-1993). In addition, I assessed the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage of Cuscuta during 1991. I determined the effect of dodder on H. spinosa reproductive success by comparing the fruit and seed production of both parasitized and non-parasitized host plants, and determining the mortality factors affecting reproductive potential. Cuscuta epithymum was found to parasitize the labelled host plants only in three of the six years of study, and only in two of the three host plant populations. The maximum percentage of infestation ocurred in 1990, in which 20% of the labelled host plants were parasitized by dodders in one population and 15% in the other population. No labelled host plant had more than 35% of its canopy surface covered by dodders. Parasitized plants were visited by fewer pollinators than were non-parasitized plants. In addition, the diversity of the pollinator assemblage also differed between these two groups of plants. The dodder did not significatively affect the fruit or seed production of its host plant, either during the study years or the years following the strong infestation. The dodder causes little harm mainly because it is scarce. However, even the relationship between an individual dodder and an individual host plant is neutral, due to the array of direct and indirect, positive and negative effects appearing between Cuscuta and H. spinosa during the sucessives phases of the reproductive cycle of the host plant.

Eighty plants belonging to three populations were permanently labelled during the period 1988-91, and in each plant the duration and date of flowering as well as the estimated flowering synchrony, were noted. The composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage, the abundance of the floral herbivores and the effect of the seed and fruit consumers were also recorded. 2 In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the relationship between the flowering synchrony and the three rate-based components of reproductive success (fruit set, brood size and female fertility) were studied. The effect of phenotypic selection on flowering synchrony, as well as on duration and time of flowering, was also studied for these three years, using the method of multiple regression for correlated characters. 3 The flowering synchrony of H. spinosa plants ranged from 0.25 to 1.00, although more than 70% of the marked plants had a flowering synchrony level greater than 0.75. The plants with a lower degree of flowering synchrony were visited by a greater number of pollinators and eaten by fewer herbivores. 4 However, only in 1989 and 1990 was there a significant relationship between flowering synchrony and brood size of the plants. In addition, the phenological traits did not affect female fertility. The results show that neither directional nor stabilizing/disruptive selection acts on flowering synchrony. For these reasons, I suggest that the flowering synchrony of H. spinosa is not regulated by selective pressure of pollinators or herbivores.

Each fruit bore an average of 5.4 ovules, of which 4.0 ovules died early in their development and 0.1 aborted. Each fruit sets an average of 1.3 mature seeds. Seed predators invariably infested more than 65% of the fruits every year, killing 87% of the seeds ripened by the plants. More than 90% of the seeds predators were weevils. However, including the other two predispersal mortality factors, we found that the main lass was to ovule death (74% of the initial number of ovules), whereas seed predation destroyed 19% of the ovules. The effect of the plant on the seed-predator survival is somewhat different. Although weevils were parasitized by a wasp, the main mortality factor during the larval stage within the fruits was starvation. Of weevil larvae, 68% died before completing the life cycle because eggs were not laid on mature seed and were unable to enter a seed. As the plant capacity for filling seeds was not correlated with herbivory, the mortality of weevil larvae depended mostly on external predispersal events."

We monitored the natural establishment of the oak for 3 years in two forest plots and two shrubland plots, by counting seedlings and juveniles. In addition, we established several experiments in these plots to examine acorn and seedling survival, while also considering the microhabitat effect on survival probability. Dispersed acorns were quickly consumed by several species of predators, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa) and woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Less than 4% of the experimental acorns survived to produce seedlings, even when they were buried 4 cm in soil, simulating caches. No effect of microhabitat was found on predation, and thus no safe site appears to exist for Q. pyrenaica acorns in the study area. Some 98% of the 1000 experimental seedlings were killed by herbivores, notably woodmice, wild boar, and domestic and wild ungulates. Seedling Survival varied spatially, being significantly higher under shrubs (4%) than in any other microhabitat (less than 0.5%)..Both acorn and seedling survival were much lower in the shrublands than in the forests. In shrubland plots, the main agent of seedling mortality was trampling by domestic ungulates foraging in herds. This study suggests that the regeneration of Q. pyrenaica forests in Mediterranean mountains can be limited by herbivores acting at several life-history stages. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ceutorhynchus sp. nov. (Curculionidae). Our experiment showed that ungulate exclusion increased Timarcha abundance. whereas Timarcha had no effect on ungulates. H. spinosa reproductive output increased threefold promptly when ungulates were excluded, although in the third year Timarcha be.-an to have effects on shrub reproduction. Ungulates affected weevils both by exploitative competition and by incidental predation, with the total number of weevils emerging per shrub being more than fourfold higher in shrubs excluded from these mammals than in shrubs open to them. In addition. during the last year. the abundance of weevils was also affected by Timarcha removal. Our study demonstrated that phytophagous insects can compete with other herbivores highly dissimilar in size, ecology, and taxonomy, such as ungulates.

Ungulate damage on Scots pines in Mediterranean environments: effects of association with shrubs	Canadian Journal of Botany-Revue Canadienne De Botanique	 	2001	JUN	79	6	739	746	"associational resistance;associational susceptibility;mammalian herbivory;Mediterranean high mountain;neighbouring effects;Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis;NEGATIVE PLANT INTERACTIONS;HERBIVORY;COMMUNITIES;STANDS;FACILITATION;PRODUCTIVITY;REGENERATION;DISPERSAL;DEFENSES;BALANCE;Plant Sciences ER"	"The spatial structure of plant communities as well as the quality and abundance of neighbours can strongly influence the intensity of herbivory suffered by a plant. In this paper, we study the effect of the association with shrubs on the ungulate herbivory suffered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ., Pinaceae) saplings in two isolated, fragmented populations in southeastern Spain. For this, we monitored herbivory on saplings with regard to the microhabitat in which they grew. We distinguished pines growing in open interspaces, on the edge of shrubs and within the canopy of shrubs, and also we distinguished four functional types of shrubs: thorny shrubs, nonthorny shrubs, thorny scrubs, and nonthorny scrubs. Our results show that association with shrubs increases the damage inflicted on Scots pine saplings. In fact, saplings growing in the open patches, far from the shrubs, escaped from herbivory more frequently and incurred less damage than did saplings growing close to shrubs. However, herbivory was also reduced when pine saplings were completely surrounded by shrubs, since then they served as a mechanical barrier. The type of neighbouring shrub did not affect the overall damage suffered by pines, despite the fact that the ungulates damaged the nonthorny scrubs more intensely than the other kinds of shrubs. Consequently, saplings have an advantage when growing within the canopy of shrubs; these constitute key microsites for pine recruitment in these Mediterranean forests."

We studied the selection exerted by several species of herbivores and pollinators in three populations of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae) in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over 4 yr by using path analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by the spatial variation in the relative importance of different interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in complex systems.

Specific objectives of the study were to quantify (i) the intensity of herbivory on reproductive structures of H. spinosa and the consequent loss of reproductive output; (ii) the frequency of herbivory, and how herbivory varied between years on the same individuals; (iii) spatial, among-population variation in herbivory intensity; and (iv) the relative importance of each herbivore species with respect to the losses in plant reproductive output. All plants of H. spinosa (n = 80) were heavily attacked by herbivores in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, where most plants were attacked by different types of herbivores during each year of the study. Plants lost about 50% of their reproductive structures during the study period. However, there was a pronounced difference in the magnitude of damage produced by each herbivore since ungulates accounted for most of the damage, whereas other herbivores caused much lighter damage. Mammalian herbivores appear to be a major ecological factor determining seed production in populations of H, spinosa."

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system."

The pollinator-exclusion experiments show that H. spinosa, under natural conditions, does not produce seed by apomixis or spontaneous autogamy. H. spinosa appears to be self-incompatible but slightly geitonogamous. Thus, this plant species needs pollen vectors for reproduction. The results of the wind-exclusion experiments performed during two different years in two populations of H. spinosa support the hypothesis that the wind acts as a pollen vector; flowers excluded from the wind had a lower fruit set and female fertility than Bowers excluded from all pollinator insects (winged and wingless). This generalist pollination system (insects and wind) permits this species to colonize and sustain viable populations in high mountains, where this species is the only woody shrub living above 3000 m above sea level in the Sierra Nevada."

By means of observational and experimental approaches, we focused on the possible regulatory effects of parasitoids on the weevil population as well as on the analysis of the sign and strength of the resulting indirect effects on plant fitness. Weevils attacked 21.7% of the fruit produced by H. spinosa during the study, selecting fruits having the most seeds. Seeds eaten by weevils were significantly bigger than uneaten ones. The number of seeds per fruit after being depredated by Ceutorhynchus was significantly smaller than for fruit not attacked. Thus, weevils affect the fitness of the host plant both by decreasing the number of seeds (quantitative effect) and by reducing the average size of surviving seeds per fruit (qualitative effect). When parasitoids were excluded experimentally, the percentage of attacked fruit (which corresponds to the number of weevil larvae) rose from 20 to 43%. We assume that the increase in the experimental weevil population may be because excluding parasitoids eliminates not only death by parasitoid oviposition for some Ceutorhynchus larvae, but also death by direct predation of parasitoids on weevil larvae. We have also experimentally verified that parasitoid activity benefits the entire plant, by way of parasitoids contributing to a higher average number of seeds dispersed per fruit in each plant, by influencing both the abundance of the weevils and the behavior of the weevil larvae.

We have quantified the abundance and foraging behavior of P. longiseta in comparison with winged flower visitors. We have also examined, by means of selective exclusion experiments, the role of ants as true pollinators, comparing them with the winged flower visitors. A total of 39 species belonging to 18 families visited the flowers of H. spinosa. All the visitors were winged insects, except P. longiseta, a species which alone made up more than 80% of the total number of insects found on the flowers. All pollinators of H. spinosa had similar foraging patterns, with 98% of total movements made between flowers within the same plant. Ants always made contact with the plant reproductive organs when foraging for nectar, and transferred large numbers of pollen grains. However, pollen exposed to ants for brief periods exhibited reduced percentage of germination. P. longiseta is both the most abundant and spatio-temporally predictable flower visitor of H. spinosa. These characteristics, weighted by their flower visitation rate, make worker ants the pollinator that maintains the strongest mutualistic interaction with H. spinosa. The exclusion experiments show that workers behave as true pollinators, since they contribute to increase the number of viable seeds produced by H. spinosa. The key factor of this interaction is mainly the great density of workers throughout the flowering period. In short, the H. spinosa-P. longiseta mutualistic interaction mainly depends on its high probability of occurrence.

We determined several plant and ant traits, as well as the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage. Insects belonging to 29 families and five orders visited the flowers of the plant species studied. In all but two, L. subulatum and G. struthium, the ants comprised 70-100% of the flower visitors. The results clearly show that five out of seven of these plant species were pollinated by ants. The role of the ants as pollinators seems to depend heavily on the relative abundance of the ants with respect to the other species of the pollinator assemblage, ant pollination becoming evident when ants outnumber other floral visitors. The ant-pollination systems analysed in this study may be the result of prevailing ecological conditions more than an evolutionary result of a specialized interaction.

Here, we provide evidence of the functional role of pollination diversity in a plant species, Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). Pollinator abundance, richness and diversity as well as plant reproduction and recruitment were determined in eight plant populations. We found that E. mediohispanicum was generalized both at the regional and local (population) scale, since its flowers were visited by more than 100 species of insects with very different morphology, size and behaviour. However, populations differed in the degree of generalization. Generalization correlated with pollinator abundance and plant population size, but not with habitat, ungulate damage intensity, altitude or spatial location. More importantly, the degree of generalization had significant consequences for plant reproduction and recruitment. Plants from populations with intermediate generalization produced more seeds than plants from populations with low or high degrees of generalization. These differences were not the result of differences in number of flowers produced per plant. In addition, seedling emergence in a common garden was highest in plants from populations with intermediate degree of generalization. This outcome suggests the existence of an optimal level of generalizations even for generalized plant species.	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0029-8549	 	"Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, Granada, Spain.

Results: Both effects benefited seedling performance. However, rnicroclimatic amelioration due to canopy shading had the strongest effect, which was particularly pronounced in the drier site. Below-ground, shrubs did not modify soil physical characteristics, organic matter, total N and P, or, water content, but significantly increased available K, which has been shown to improve seedling water-Use efficiency under drought conditions.

Common reforestation techniques treat these shrubs as competitors against newly planted tree seedlings; thus shrubs are cleared before tree plantation. However, empirical studies and theory governing plant-plant interactions suggest that, in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs can have a net positive effect on recruitment of other species. Between 1997 and 2001, we carried out experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area (southeast Spain) with the aim of comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas (the current reforestation technique) with seedlings planted under the canopy of preexisting shrub species. Over 18000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area. We sought to explore variation in the sign and magnitude of interactions along spatial gradients defined by altitude and aspect. In the present work, we report the results of a meta-analysis conducted with seedling survival and growth data for the first summer following planting, the most critical period for reforestation success in Mediterranean areas. The facilitative effect was consistent in all environmental situations explored (grand mean effect size d(+) = 0.89 for survival and 0.27 for growth). However, there were differences in the magnitude of the interaction, depending on the seedling species planted as well as the nurse shrub species involved. Additionally, nurse shrubs had a stronger facilitative effect on seedling survival and growth at low attitudes and sunny, drier slopes than at high altitudes or shady, wetter slopes. Facilitation in the dry years proved higher than in the one wet year. Our results show that pioneer shrubs facilitate the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species and thus can positively affect reforestation success in many different ecological settings."

High-pressure assemblages are not preserved in the dated gneisses due to intense retrograde overprinting during exhumation. Nevertheless, thermobarometry performed in adjacent skarn rocks and metapelites indicates maximum temperatures and pressures ranging from 605 +/- 74 to 715 +/- 72 degrees C and from 11.0 +/- 2.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.5 kbar. SHRIMP ion microprobe U-Pb analyses were performed on zircons from one gneiss. The zircon crystals display igneous oscillatory-zoned domains, with an age of 301 +/- 7 Ma (95% c.l.), rimmed by dark, unzoned overgrowths of metamorphic origin (mean age of 16.5 +/- 0.4 Ma). The former age is interpreted as dating the crystallisation of the granitic protolith of the gneiss. This implies a pre-Permian age for the Nevado-Filabride marbles, traditionally considered to be Triassic, and a Palaeozoic age for the complete sequence of the upper part of the Complex. Accordingly, in western Sierra Nevada, the observed succession from the Nevado-Filabride Complex to the Alpujarride Complex (Permo-Triassic phyllites and Triassic marbles) can be considered normal from a stratigraphic point of view. Therefore, the present-day contact between the two complexes, the Mecina Fault in Sierra Nevada, is interpreted as a normal fault generated during exhumation rather than a thrust structure. The age of the metamorphic zircon overgrowths (16.5 0.4 Ma) is likely to be related to decompression, as suggested by titanite inclusions found in zircon. Titanite postdates rutile, the high-pressure Ti-rich phase. This indicates exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride Complex significantly after the Alpujarride Complex (similar to 18 Ma).

The effect of the removal of Timarcha lugens (Chrysomelidae), one of the main herbivores of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae), on the abundance of co-occurring phytophagous insects, the abundance of non-phytophagous arthropods (detritivores, predators, and parasitoids), and the structure and diversity of the entire arthropod community, was studied for 3 years (1999-2001). 2. There was competition between T. lugens and co-occurring herbivores; the removal of T. lugens was correlated with an increase in the abundance of sap-suckers, flower-feeders, and, above all, folivores. 3. Timarcha lugens also had an indirect effect on arthropods belonging to other trophic levels; the abundance of predators increased significantly after the removal of T. lugens . 4. Community composition was affected by the experimental removal. In addition, the diversity of the overall community increased after removal of T. lugens . 5. The study demonstrated experimentally that T. lugens has a significant effect not only on other species belonging to the same trophic level, but also on the abundance of species belonging to higher trophic levels, and, consequently, on the entire structure and diversity of the complex community in which it is immersed."

Metapopulation dynamics should be more important at the borders of species distributions due to two main factors: (1) populations are less abundant and fluctuate more at the borders than in the centre of their distributions, and (2) resources in the range margins of species distributions are often more scarce and fragmented. 2. Most metapopulation studies have been performed in a fraction of the entire distribution of species. The main goal here is to study the population dynamics of a narrowly distributed species including both the borders and the centre of the distribution, and to test the predictions described above. 3. The density and extinction events in a patchily distributed species, Timarcha lugens, was quantified for 5 years along an altitudinal gradient including the upper and lower limits of the species distribution. The dispersal ability of Timarcha was also studied using a mark-release-recapture study. 4. Extinction events and empty patches were only found at the borders of Timarcha distribution. The fluctuation in beetle density was greater in patches suffering extinction events. Resource abundance was negatively related to beetle density and positively related to extinction events. In addition, the dispersal rate among patches was very low and beetles moved distances of no further than 25 in. 5. Population density governs the extinction events in this system, and its fluctuation was more evident near the border of the distribution. Both factors together with the relative population stability in patches at medium and high altitudes, and the low dispersal rate of the individuals support the idea of a source-sink metapopulation structure in T. lugens.

Although the role of spatial pattern in models on metapopulation dynamics has recently been recognized, there is a lack of empirical studies accounting for the consequences of considering autocorrelation in these processes. Here, we show that the conventional statistical methods used for determining the factors controlling species population dynamics (species density, sex ratio, and extinction events) can be strongly affected by spatial autocorrelation. Under these circumstances, the use of a spatially explicit model is highly recommended in order to demonstrate the real factor controlling species population dynamics. Moreover, presenting erroneous conclusions concerning the real factors governing species population dynamics could have far-reaching consequences in the management and conservation of many endangered species.

We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded from ungulates. In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of ungulates depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, ungulates also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, ungulates can still have a strong effect on arthropod communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between ungulates and arthropods differed depending on the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained for a group of insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities.

Although most researchers agree that processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales affect ecological communities, empirical support is still scarce. In this paper, we seek to discern whether the relationship between abundance, biomass, and species diversity, on the one hand, and habitat heterogeneity, on the other, holds across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, we analyse whether the pattern/variation found depends on the taxonomic level, and the diversity index used. To answer these questions, we sampled arthropod assemblages across three nested temporal and spatial scales. In general, we found variability in the responses to habitat heterogeneity across scales according to the assemblage descriptor, the taxonomic level selected, and the diversity index used. Our results suggest that generalization is difficult and extrapolation should be made with caution. Moreover, the use of more than one diversity index would provide additional and complementary information about species-distribution patterns and the mechanisms generating these patterns.

These populations are isolated in high mountains, which tends to protect them from the attack of a severe defoliating Mediterranean pest, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. However, as a consequence of climate change, the pine processionary caterpillar has increasingly attacked populations of this pine in recent years. This work describes the detrimental effects of defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar in P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis in Sierra Nevada. Defoliation strongly reduced pine growth as well as all the reproductive parameters measured (female and male cone production, mature cone size, seed production and seed weight), in addition to some deaths. If winter temperatures continue to increase; the pine processionary caterpillar will have a dangerous impact in these relict pine populations, by further reducing the pine's weak regeneration capacity. We suggest some mitigation actions based on managing habitat structure, in order to reduce or avoid such negative impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

This study analyses the foreseeable consequences of climatic warming in the distribution and dynamics of a Mediterranean pest that causes severe defoliation, the pine processionary caterpillar Thaumetopoea pityocampa, and the effects upon the relict Andalusian Scots pine Pinus sylvestris nevadensis in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southeastern Spain). We correlated a set of regional data of infestation by T. pityocampa upon Scots pine, from a broad ecological gradient, with climatic data for the period 1991-2001, characterized by alternating warm and cold winters. Defoliation intensity shows a significant association with previous warm winters, implying that climatic warming will intensify the interaction between the pest and the Scots pine. The homogeneous structure of the afforested pine woodlands favours the outbreak capacity of the newcomer, promoting this new interaction between a Mediterranean caterpillar pest and a boreal tree at its southern distribution limit.

The work reported here analysed host utilisation by the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), the relationship between moth oviposition patterns and larval performance, the chemical characteristics of the plant in relation to the performance of different larval instars, and the role of these factors in the outbreak capacity of the species. In order to do this, a combination of field and laboratory techniques was used to study three pine species differing in nutritional characteristics. 2. Moths oviposited in the three pine species analysed, although cluster pine received a lower number of batches. Late-instar larvae were able to feed on all three pine species, however first-instar larvae developed on Scots and black pine but died on cluster pine. Consequently, oviposition in cluster pine can be considered an oviposition mistake, and indicates that moths are rather unselective when ovipositing on different pine species. 3. Chemical analysis of needles suggested that the quantity of nitrogen was the main factor responsible for the difference in survival of larvae. 4. The oviposition pattern of the moth and the larval susceptibility to food quality in Thaumetopoea pityocampa agree with the theory that unselective oviposition of the moth is a precondition for eruptive dynamics in phytophagous insects. 5. The success of the larvae depends mainly on the probability of the moth finding a suitable host. This probability is determined strongly by the changes of structure and coverage in Mediterranean pine woodlands, due to human management.

Egg batches of the pine processionary moth were placed on four groups of Scots pines that underwent different periods of herbivory. The larval survival was related to the nitrogen content, fibre, phenolics and terpenes in the needles. Larval survival was higher in undefoliated pines, lower in pines defoliated two consecutive years, and intermediate in pines defoliated only one year, suggesting a direct relationship between previous defoliation and larval survival. In contrast, none of the characteristics of the needles showed a clear relationship with larval survival. The resulting reduction in larval number also affects the capacity of the larvae to develop during winter, because it hampered nest warming. Thus, previous defoliation limits, although it does not impede, the possibility of repeated defoliation on Scots pine. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

This behaviour led us to investigate whether a particular type of rock is selected, and, if so, the advantages to this species of the selection. This study was located at 2400 m above sea-level in the Sierra Nevada mountains (Granada, Spain). To determine the range of rock sizes available, in eight control plots the thicknesses were recorded and also the maximum and minimum diameters of all rocks with surface area of more than 6 cm2. A total of 1724 rocks were recorded, noting among the rock types available those that were used for nesting. Also as a preliminary estimate of the thermal characteristics of the rocks, we recorded the temperatures of the air, soil surface, soil under a rock covering an ant nest, and soil at 30 cm depth. The results indicate that P. longiseta selects flat rocks with a surface area/thickness ratio of 2-5, the thickness being not less than 1.5 cm, the surface area being 50-250 cm2 and volume less than 1000 cm3. This type of rock offers the nests two beneficial but apparently contradictory effects: (1) protection against high temperatures on hot days, and (2) warmth on colder days by absorbing the diffusing solar heat more effectively than the air or soil around the nest.

To test this, we studied the relationship between density and growth, mortality, and emigration of brown trout in two alpine streams and a set of stream channels in eastern California. We sampled trout at the scale of ""segments"" (5-31 m long riffles, runs, and pools) and ""sections"" (340-500 m in length) of Convict Creek over a 3-yr period. Trout were also sampled during 6 yr in seven 90-m sections of Mammoth Creek. For 2 yr, we manipulated trout densities in Convict Creek by removing trout from two sections and adding trout to two other sections. We also manipulated densities in seven 50-m stream channels, using a natural size distribution of trout in one year and underyearlings only in a second year. In both streams, average size (body length or mass) of underyearlings in fall was negatively related to trout density and was furthermore affected by sampling location and year. The strong, negative relationship between individual mass and density of trout could be detected at the spatial scale of whole sections, but not at the scale of individual segments. The Convict Creek and stream channel experiments also revealed strong negative effects of density on average mass of underyearlings in fall, and on proportional mass increase of yearling and older trout from spring to fall. In contrast, mortality and emigration were unrelated to initial stocking densities in the channels. In all our data, the negative effects on growth were most pronounced at densities <1 trout/m(2) and the growth-density relationships were well described by negative power curves. Large individuals were always less affected by increasing trout density than were small individuals, suggesting a competitive advantage of large over small trout that increased with density. We conclude that individual growth of brown trout in streams can be affected by trout density to an extent that suggests a substantial influence on population regulation. Results from our multiyear, multiscale, and experimental study indicate that density dependence in the growth of stream salmonids will be difficult to detect in purely observational data, especially in systems with relatively high fish densities (where the growth-density relationship has a flat slope), when data are collected and analyzed at small spatial scales, and when insufficient information is collected to assess the contribution of interannual variation in growth."

(Viscaceae). Arceuthobium americanum infects three principal hosts and has the most extensive geographical range of any North American dwarf mistletoe. Based on the lack of apparent morphological and phenological differences between populations of A. americanum, past researchers have found no evidence for recognizing infraspecific taxa. In this study, molecular analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis indicated that A. americanum is divided into three distinct genetic races, each associated with a different host taxon in regions of allopatry: (i) Pinus banksiana in western Canada, (ii) Pinus contorta var. murrayana in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountain ranges in the western US; and (iii) Pinus contorta var. latifolia in the western US and Canada. These observations suggest that host identity, geographical isolation and environmental factors have contributed to race formation in A. americanum. The lack of fine-scale patterning within each of the A. americanum races is attributed to random dispersal of seeds over long distances by animal vectors. Historical factors such as glaciations and founder events have also influenced structuring and genetic diversity in A. americanum populations. Given sufficient time, it is possible that these races will become reproductively isolated and undergo speciation."

Resolving denudational histories in orogenic belts with apatite fission-track thermochronology and structural data: An example from southern Spain	Geology	Geology	1997	JUL	25	7	623	626	"SE SPAIN;BETIC CORDILLERAS;CONSTRAINTS;UPLIFT;BASIN;RANGE;Geology ER"	Interpreting apatite fission-track thermochronology !(AFTT) data obtained from orogenic belts presents a considerable challenge because of the complexity of denudational processes operating in this tectonic setting. An approach which integrates kinematic, foliation, and thermochronologic data is advocated, and an example from southern Spain is used as an illustration. AMT ages from the Sierra Nevada are negatively correlated with their elevation precluding interpretation in terms of simple erosive denudation. However, when additional structural data is included in the analysis, a complex denudation history is obtained. An initial phase of tectonic denudation was responsible for the cooling that produced the oldest apparent ages. Thereafter, folding accompanied by differential erosive denudation caused cooling of samples inferred to have been as much as 4.5 km below the detachment. The second phase of cooling began in the late Miocene-early Pliocene.

The zone is separated from the overlying Alpujarride Complex by a crustal scale shear zone that has variously been interpreted as a thrust or an extensional detachment. A suite of 74 new apatite and zircon fission track results have been obtained from the Nevado-Filabride Complex and these have been used to define regional cooling patterns for the complex. Rapid cooling (105 degrees C-200 degrees C Ma(-1)) is spatially related to the tectonic contact with the overlying Alpujarride Complex. Cooling to near-surface temperatures occurred first in the east (Sierra de los Filabres) during the mid-Serravallian (12+/-1 Ma) and was completed by the early Tortonian (9-8 Ma) in the west (Sierra Nevada). There is no correlation between fission track age and sample elevation. These results are consistent with tectonic unroofing of this complex, a finding that favors extension as the mechanism by which the two complexes were brought into contact. Extension spans the middle and earliest upper Miocene (12-8 Ma) in the study area and therefore lasted much longer than previously documented. A hypothesis is advanced which links oblique convergence between the Iberian plate and the Betic internal Zones, resulting in crustal contraction at depth, with orogen parallel extension in the middle and upper crust.

In Kernera saxatilis, Silene rupestris and Gentiana alpina we found intraspecific phylogroups corresponding to mountain regions as predicted by the vicariance hypothesis. Moreover, genetic distances between Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees populations were always higher than those between populations from the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. This suggests successive disruption of gene exchange between mountain ranges as postglacial climatic warming proceeded from south to north. In Papaver alpinum, our data indicate that a central Pyrenean population arose via long-distance dispersal from the Sierra Nevada, and that vicariant separation events between the Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees and between the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps occurred simultaneously. Overall, Sierra Nevada populations of all species investigated here preserve unexpectedly high (or not exceptionally reduced) genetic diversity. This testifies to the important influence of long-term isolation, i.e. vicariance, on genetic diversity through fostering the accumulation of new mutations and/or the fixation of ancestral ones.

This study uses RAPD data, as a total DNA marker, and morphometrics, as potentially revealing hybridization and introgression, to throw further light on the origin of the above mentioned contact zone. Individuals of the two taxa sampled from the range do not show a F1 hybrid profile for RAPD or for morphometrics. To integrate these results with the previously published sequence data (ITS and chloroplast spacer trnL-F) it is proposed that introgressive hybridization has occurred in A. villosa subsp. bernisii, whereas for A. filicaulis the contact zone occurs at the intraspecific level. With the available data, the contact between individuals of Armeria with different genotypes in the two taxa may have implied westward migration from a biodiverse massif like Sierra Nevada, and this may apply to other organisms although further data are needed to confirm it.

As a result of the importance of orography in much of the southern areas, such displacements must have involved populations ascending or descending mountains. The present study provides support for glacial-induced altitudinal migrations from chloroplast phylogeographic patterns in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae) in southeast Spain. One hundred and five sequences of the trnL-F spacer were obtained from seven species. Fifteen different haplotypes were recognized, their genealogy was inferred, and associations with geography were explored using nested clade analysis. Seven instances were detected in which the same haplotype is shared by two or three species within a particular massif. In all the cases, at least one of the species involved displayed different haplotypes in other areas; in most, the haplotype shared is predominant either in one of the species involved or in the massif. These patterns of haplotype sharing strongly suggest horizontal transfer between species. In one of the massifs (Sierra Nevada) the three species involved in haplotype sharing (A. splendens , A. filicaulis ssp. nevadensis , A. villosa ssp. bernisii ) occur at markedly different altitudinal belts.

Mountainous topography up to 2000 m lines the Mediterranean coastal margin of Cataluna (Spain) despite a crustal thickness of 22 km at the coast. Geometric analysis of topographic profiles indicates a strong link between topography and extensional tectonics. Trends in maximum, mean and minimum elevations show marked regional increases in a SW-NE direction along the axis of the Ebro basin towards the active Amer-Brugent normal fault. From patterns of local relief, characteristics of the fluvial drainage network, location of drainage divides, and degree of escarpment retreat, we distinguish two overlapping areas of mountainous topography, a southern area related to late Oligocene to middle Miocene rifting and a northern area related to late Miocene to Quaternary rifting. The youthful topography in the northern area likely results from mechanical unloading of the footwall of the Amer-Brugent normal fault. In the southern area (encompassing the Catalan Coastal Ranges), erosion continuously renews topography produced by rifting while causing headward erosion of coastal rivers into the Ebro basin. Elevated topography along the Catalan margin derives principally from flexural isostatic rebound due to tectonic and erosional denudation, causing exhumation of the rifted margin. Nonetheless, the height of the mountains and the thinness of the crust suggest an additional component of dynamic or thermal support of mountainous topography, likely buoyancy forces from density differences in the mantle.

It was isolated from a high-mountain lake in the Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain), the highest mountain range in the Iberian Peninsula. The new taxon was characterised by its valve morphology and number of striae. Morphometric analysis suggested a relationships between F. nevadensis and the F. capucina complex, which is well represented in the Sierra Nevada by the variety rumpens. The comparison of F. nevadensis morphometric data of with those of other similar species showed that they are closely related to F. capucina var. austriaca. The ecological conditions of F. nevadensis and F. capucina var. austriaca are similar, both species growing in cold mountain waters (while F. heidenii and other similar species live in different kinds of water with a wider salinity spectrum).

From period,analyses of the data, three pulsation frequencies, 9.3299 cd(-1), 10.8483 cd(-1) and 3.6035 cd(-1) were obtained. We derived color indices: b - y = 0.215, m(1) = 0.169, c(1) = 0.783, and beta = 2.775. With these indices and some calibrations, we obtain: M-v = 2.44, M-bol = 2.27, logL/L-circle dot = 0.99, and logT(eff) = 3.875. Evolutionary sequences of stellar models with 1.00-2.00 solar masses, at steps of 0.05 M-circle dot are computed. Each sequence consists of 220 evolutionary intervals. From a comparison between the observed and calculated physical parameters we conclude that UV Tri is in an early, evolutionary phase before the turn-off point.

In order to determine its frequencies and pulsation modes accurately it was observed at the Xinglong Station in 1998 and 1999, and at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Spain) in 1999. Period analyses were made for our data set (1997) and the data set (1997-1999). From the combined data set (1997-1999), the values of two frequencies are: 16.8493 and 23.0613 cd(-1). From our photoelectric observations, we obtained two physical parameters of SAO 16394: log L/L-. = 1.16, log T-eff = 3.92. We calculated the evolution sequences of stellar models with 1.00-2.00 solar mass in steps of 0.05 M-. and 8 physical parameters of each evolutionary phase. We suggest that the evolutionary sequence of the 1.85 M-. model might represent the evolutionary sequence of SAO 16394. The 30th evolutionary phase of the evolutionary sequence of the model with 1.85 M-. might represent the current location of SAO 16394. Depending on the Q values (Q(1) = 0.0336 day, Q(2) = 0.0246 day) and frequency ratio f(1)/f(2) = 0.7306 we identify f(1) (16.8493 cd(-1)) as the radial fundamental mode, f(i) (23.0613 cd(-1)) as its first overtone.

However, numerous species are threatened by different human activities and by global climatic change. In this work, we provide data on the conservational state of orophilous plants of the Baetic range and propose priorities for their protection. For this, we analysed 82 threatened taxa and 17 mountain areas using correspondence analysis (CA) and complementarity analysis. Of the 2,197.5 km(2) of high-mountain areas analysed, only 1,654.5 km(2) are currently protected (75.3%). Of the 82 threatened species, 16 have no type of protection, eight are critically endangered and six are endangered (according to the categories of the UICN): Overgrazing and natural causes are the main factors threatening most of the species. The Sierra Nevada mountain (Granada and Almeria provinces) and Cazorla-Segura mountain Jaen province) provide protection for 67.5% of the total number of threatened orophilous species, and 71.7% of the species evaluated as critically endangered. We propose Gador and Sagra mountains as new priority areas for the conservation of threatened orophilous flora.

In this context, performed germination experiments were performed with a set of 37 endemic, rare or often endangered, taxa of the Sierra Nevada high mountain (SE Spain), an area that constitutes a hotspot of diversity in the Mediterranean region. Seed germination varied depending on the species, from 0% to ca. 95%. A group of 10 species belonging to 9 families showed a low or null germination percentage. Dormancy in these species is likely to be complex and to involve some kind of physiological ground. A second group of species showed a germination percentage between 5 and 20%, most of these belonging to families producing hard-coated seeds (e.g. Papillionaceae, Geraniaceae). Treatments to promote their germination were thus easy to apply. A large fraction of taxa had a germination percentage above 20%, often above 50%. The germination percentage did not correlate positively with the speed of germination (estimated as the T-50) or with altitude, but correlated negatively (although weakly) with diaspore mass. Families such as Compositae, Cruciferae, Geraniaceae, Labiatae and Papillionaceae are identified as families where seed germination may not imply major problems. Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. nevadensis, Arenaria nevadensis, Carex camposii, Gentiana lutea, Linaria glacialis, Narcissus nevadensis, Nardus stricta, Odontites granatensis, Papaver lapeyrousianum and Sorbus hybrida need studies of dormancy breakage to establish guidelines to optimize management of the scant seed material. As a whole, the results contrast with the generalized idea of a high level of dormancy in alpine species.

Picual) trees under three different types of soil management: (1) non-tillage with barley (Hordeum vulgare) strips of 4 m width (BS); (2) conventional tillage (CT); (3) non-tillage without plant strips (NT). The erosion plots, located in Lanjaron (Alpujarras) on the southern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in south-eastern Spain, had 30% slope at an altitude of 565 m and 192 m(2) (24 x 8 m) in area. The highest erosion and runoff values, ranging from 10.5 to 40.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and from 26.5 to 51.5 mm yr(-1) respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under NT. In CT, erosion ranged from 1.0 to 10.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 6.7 to 15.2 mm yr(-1), while under BS, erosion ranged from 1.7 to 2.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 19.6 to 20.0 mm yr(-1). It is concluded that the BS and CT reduced the soil erosion by 92% and 78%, with respect to the NT, and the runoff by 49% and 72%, respectively. The total NPK losses (sediments and runoff) from BS averaged 0.87, 0.07 and 0.72 kg ha(-1), from CT 1.82, 0.11 and 0.97 kg ha(-1) and from NT 3.15, 0.29 and 2.45 kg ha(-1), respectively. In addition, nutrient concentrations in the surface runoff were higher than the recommended level for standard water quality for N-NO3, N-NH4 and soluble P, particularly from NT and CT. These results support the recommendation of non-tillage with barley strips for sloped agricultural land in order to reduce erosion and pollution. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The degree of use was 15% for herbaceous vegetation and 10.3% for woody vegetation, The most used species were those with moderate amounts in diet composition of both ruminants. The main plant groups consumed by Spanish ibex were graminoids (57.5%), shrubs (20.5%) and chamaephytes (14.3%). Sheep consumed graminoids (41.6%), forbs (32.3%) and chamaephytes (20.9%). There was a significant correlation between the two diets, with an overlap of 56.3%. The highest indices of selection were found in items with moderate-low availability and which comprised moderate levels in the diet composition of the two species. Spanish ibex mainly selected diet according to availability, while sheep selection depended on protein content, The ibex consumed cell wall-rich resources such as grasses and shrubs, while the sheep consumed higher quality feed and includes more forbs in its diet.

The study was carried out in July, and primarily focused on diet selection. Food availability, diet composition, species selection indices, and the effect of plant availability and chemical composition on diet selection in each zone were analysed. In the high zone, the availability of herbaceous resources was much greater than that of woody species, while in the mid-altitude zone, both resource types were almost equally abundant. Resource availability in both zones had a 36% index of similarity. Herbaceous plants were the predominant dietary component in both zones, and diet similarity was 51%. The greater similarity found between the two diet compositions than between the two resource availabilities revealed preferences for common species in both zones. The Spanish ibex selected food items with moderate levels in diet composition, a degree of quality (high protein content and digestibility) and moderate availability. In the high zone, the ibex selected its diet according to the protein content, while in the mid-altitude zone the food choice was mainly influenced by availability. Spatial heterogeneity probably influenced the difference detected in terms of the feeding strategy used in each area.

Core rocks record a clockwise P-T-t path with segments of quasi-isothermal decompression that do not cross the melting solidi. Doming was caused by the interference of two orthogonal sets of Miocene-Pliocene, large-scale open folds (trending roughly E-W and N-S) that warp both WSW-directed extensional detachments and the footwall regional foliation. N-S folds were generated by a rolling hinge mechanism while E-W folds formed due to shortening perpendicular to the direction of extension. Strike-slip faults striking subparallel to the direction of extension laterally bound the domes, adjoining highly extended domains to less extended blocks. Using a three-dimensional model of the crustal structure of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome constrained by surface geological data, the relationships with present-day topography, and the deep crustal structure, this paper explores the role of crustal flow in the origin and evolution of the dome. Collectively, the crustal structure, the rheological considerations, and other geophysical data suggest the occurrence of flow channels at two levels: mid-crustal depths and the deep crust. Flow in the upper channel is closely related to the mode of footwall denudation by detachment unroofing. The flowing channel in the deep crust is probably induced by the NW-SE crustal thinning pattern inferred for the region, with a relatively thick crust at the NW, and is likely to be oblique to the direction of extension in the upper crust. A geometric model assuming footwall deformation by subvertical simple shear examines the possible exhumation paths of the lower-plate rocks and the evolution of the dome core in the upper crust during extension. In this model, the dome width measured parallel to the direction of extension can be used to estimate the amount of horizontal extension, once the dip of the non-readjusted segment of the detachment is well constrained. Finally, we also discuss two interesting associated problems common in extensional tectonics; namely, ( 1) what causes mountain uplift in recently extended continental terrains? and ( 2) what holds up high mountain belts in these regions where the Moho is often subhorizontal? A rolling hinge model and simultaneous transverse shortening can explain the high values of extension, the orthogonal folding, and the high mountains in the Sierra Nevada elongated dome. Flow beneath the dome of a relatively low-velocity, highly conductive, and probably low-density crustal material can support the high topography."

Faults of the Alpujarras fault zone define a regional-scale complex ENE-striking transfer zone that marks the boundary among the Sierra Nevada elongated dome, a highly-extended, constricted core-complex, and a less-extended domain formed by large-scale tilt-blocks. Detailed mapping and structural analysis show that the Alpujarras fault zone is an integral part of the WSW-directed normal fault systems that thinned the Betic hinterland during the middle Miocene to Recent time. Fault patterns and palaeostress analysis both indicate that dextral movement along the strike-slip faults was induced by a local stress field with a sub-horizontal E-W- to ESE-WNW-trending maximum principal stress axis, which is synchronous with the regional stress field driving the normal fault systems. Palaeostress analysis also indicates subsequent variations in the stress field with a sub-horizontal NW-SE- to N-S-trending maximum principal stress axis, thus producing both the tectonic inversion of the northern fault of the Alpujarras system and shortening of the unloaded extensional detachment footwall. A simplified kinematic model for the tectonic evolution of the Alpujarras area from the middle Miocene to Recent emphasizes the kinematic coupling of normal faults and strike-slip transfer zones in the extensional process.

The hanging-wall block, known as the Alboran domain, has undergone more than 300 km migration from a more easterly position, where it was the continuation of the Alpine Cretaceous-Paleogene orogen. Contemporaneous with thin-skinned thrusting in the footwall, the Alboran domain underwent two episodes of nearly extension in which extensional orthogonal developed with directions of extension NNW-SSE system, orthogonal to the belt axis, in the late Burdigalian-Langhian to a WSW directed orogen-parallel one in the Serravallian. The superposition of these two systems resulted in a chocolate tablet megastructure. This extensional pattern is not satisfactorily explained in previously proposed models for the evolution of the are. Orthogonal extension is plausible in a process of the gravitational collapse of an overthickened crust; nevertheless, orogen-parallel extension is more difficult to explain in this context. We advocate that the WSW directed low-angle normal faults formed during large-scale extension in connection with important westward are migration. The driving force of extension in a general context of convergence is controversial and varies between a removal model and a delamination model. on both the timing and the kinematics of extension, as presented in this paper, seem to support the contribution of both mechanisms. Convective removal may have started the process, but continued N-S convergence could have resulted in westward tectonic escape and asymmetric lateral inflow of asthenospheric material accompanying lithospheric delamination."

Folding accompanied tectonic denudation developing elongated domes with fold axes both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of extension. The geometry, kinematics, and tectonic evolution of two major sequentially developed extensional fault systems have been characterized in several E-W elongated mountain ranges of the central Betics on the basis of new cartographic and structural data and a comprehensive revision of other available geological and geophysical observations. The extensional systems have an average WSW direction of extension and led to exhumation of the two lower metamorphic complexes of the Betics, the Nevado-Filabride and the Alpujarride, during the middle and upper Miocene (Serravallian to Tortonian). The extended domain contains a core complex, with distal and proximal antiformal hinges separated by around 60 km and with a fold amplitude of similar to6 km (measured parallel to the direction of extension). The total amount of extension across the core complex is about 109-116 km, corresponding to a stretching factor (beta) of 3.5-3.9, estimated using the distance between fold axial surfaces and a geometrical model accomplishing footwall deformation during tectonic denudation via subvertical simple shear. The elongated domal and basinal geometry of the detachments and their respective footwalls is due to the interference between two sets of orthogonal large-scale open folds, trending N-S and E-W. Longitudinal, N-S trending folds are interpreted as isostatic folds, i.e., folds that developed in response to differential unloading of the extensional detachment footwalls inducing ductile flow in the middle crust. These folds formed in a rolling-hinge anticline in which rotation migrates westward through the footwall as it is progressively unroofed. In contrast, E-W trending folds, being subparallel to the direction of extension, have a contractional origin and progressively affect to the west the isostatically readjusted segments of the detachments once they are inactive. Orthogonal folding occurred since the Serravallian to lower Pliocene. Extension is still active from the rolling-hinge anticline in Sierra Nevada to the west. The middle Miocene to Pliocene tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome at the core of the Betic hinterland is another example of the coexistence of extension and contraction during continued overall convergence and mountain-building.

The core-bounding detachment system formed during the Serravallian (15-11 Ma) in an episode of ENE-WSW extension. The ESCI-Beticas 2 deep seismic reflection profile, a transect through the core, shows a highly reflective deep crust overlying a subhorizontal Moho, and a fairly transparent upper crust and upper mantle. The lack of Moho relief beneath this area, with differential values for supracrustal thinning, suggests a mechanism of intracrustal isostatic compensation. Surface geology data together with seismic imaging indicate intracrustal flow and upward doming as a response to footwall unloading accompanying the middle Miocene supracrustal extension. A prominent mid-crustal reflector (MCR) is deemed to represent a decoupling zone between the upper and the deep crust. Subsequent N-S shortening and associated folding occurred in the late Miocene. The interference pattern of this folding over the middle Miocene core produced the current E-W dome-shaped tectonic windows where the deepest complex of the Betic hinterland crops out.

Are Mediterranean mountains Entisols weakly developed? The case of orthents from Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain)	Geoderma	Geoderma	2004	JAN	118	01-Feb	115	131	"mountain soils;orthent;quartz sands;quartz weathering;Sierra Nevada (Spain);pedogenic evolution;ultramicrofabric;QUARTZ DISSOLUTION RATES;GRAIN SURFACE TEXTURES;ELECTRON MICROSCOPY;DUNE SANDS;RED SOILS;MORPHOLOGY;Agriculture ER"	Two Orthents from Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain), classified as loamy-skeletal mesic Typic Xerorthent and loamy-skeletal frigid Lithic Cryorthent were studied. They were situated at 1460 and 2000 m, derived from micaschists and quart zites under Mediterranean mountain climate conditions with mesic and cryic temperature regimes and xeric moisture regime. These Orthents are weakly developed, as shown by their reduced thickness, their lack of diagnostics subsurface horizons, sandy loam textures, skeletal, and lithochromic colors. Quartz is present in significant amounts, particularly in the fine light sand fraction. Analysis of the quartz grains of the fine light sand by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and backscattered electron images (BSE) revealed the presence of significant physical and chemical alteration features such as fractures, corrosion gulfs, fields of etch pits and dissolution of intergranular surfaces. This process is confirmed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) since the edges of the quartz grains have a higher proportion of cations other than Si, compared to their centre. Further evidence indicates the authigenic nature of the process. Starting from quartz etching an assessment of soil weathering has been made (W index from Marcelino et al. (1999). The alteration of the quartz, together with the development of a ultramicrofabric with several fabric units (investigated with SEM), and other characteristics (mineralogical, chemical, etc.) are considered indicative of some pedogenic evolution. These facts are especially interesting in the case of weakly developed Mediterranean mountain soils from Sierra Nevada, where processes of chemical weathering have traditionally not been considered very active.

Mineral formation in micaceous Mediterranean Red soils of Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain	European Journal of Soil Science	Eur.J.Soil Sci.	1998	JUN	49	2	253	268	"ILLITE;HEMATITE;MICAS;Agriculture ER"	We investigated the processes of mineral formation in three Alfisol profiles of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), with special emphasis on the little-studied process of mica inheritance, particularly as regards its quantitative aspects. X-ray diffraction, conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and geochemical analysis of the soil solution were used, and the granulometric fractions gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, silt and clay were studied, as was unaltered parent rock. Most interesting was inheritance of dioctahedral mica (illites) with small crystallochemical changes. The transition of mica from parent rock to clay was characterized by small crystallochemical changes affecting their structural formulae, reduction of the 2M(1) polytype content, decrease in crystallite size, increase in crystal defects, and other changes in particle morphology. We propose the term 'pedocrystallochemical evolution' for the transition. The changes reverse the processes that take place in micas when rocks are formed by sedimentation, diagenesis and metamorphism. The kaolinite in the soils is a result of neoformation, and acts as the equilibrium phase within the chemical system. Reddening seems to have been caused by both inheritance and neoformation of iron oxides (haematite + goethite).

The gravels had undergone considerable modification during weathering in soil. A loss of the primary rock structure was detected, together with a decrease in compactness, an increase in roundness, color value and chroma. Neoformed kaolinite was present and relatively high contents of extractable forms of iron, aluminium and silica (citrate-dithionite and oxalate) were detected. From an analytical point of view, the surface properties (CEC and SSA) increased and the equilibrium pH decreased in the clasts which had undergone most weathering. The SEM study shows that the fabric changes from laminar schistose in the parent rock to other types in the gravels due to the weathering process. Electron microprobe analysis revealed the presence of phyllosilicates together with iron oxides in the illuvial infilling materials of fissures in the most altered clasts. These infillings affect the properties of the coarse fragments. The relationship detected between the properties of fine earth and those of the gravel fractions suggest that the coarse fragments have a significant influence on the properties of the soil.

Discrepancies mainly involve the status of O. similis and O. opacicollis. A genetic analysis of nine populations of this complex using eight loci is presented, indicating that: (i) O. fracticornis is a good species, and (ii) the genetic distances between O. opacicollis and 0. similis populations as a function of the biogeographic scenery (allopatry versus sympatry), indicate that they are not completely reproductively isolated across their entire geographic range, thus suggesting a still unfinished speciation in different areas. The data demonstrate both the existence of some gene flow between O. opacicollis and O. simulis in one place ('El Barraco'; Central Spain) and isolation in others ('S-a Nevada'; South-east Spain).

The number of elements per strophe (strophe length) is the only difference between strophes of the same male, and the main difference between males. The function of this song was analysed in a colour-ringed population of Hoopoes in Granada, southern Spain, by monitoring the pattern of male song activity and response to an experimental song throughout the breeding season. Both spontaneous songs and responses to playback experiments decreased after the onset of egg-laying, and song production was not associated with feeding sites or nest holes. Moreover, some of the breeding males that had lost their females resumed singing, Males also used song to recover lost contacts with their mates. These findings suggest that the principal function of song in the Hoopoe is intersexual, for attracting females, and that, in an intrasexual context, its use is restricted to defence of mates. The dual function of Hoopoe song suggests that it provides information both for males and females, probably about male quality.

The song of males in this species is very simple, with a repertoire size of one. The strophes of a male only differ in the number of elements that they include (strophe length), and strophe length is the main song feature differing between males. During the prelaying period each individual used mainly strophes of only two lengths, between 2 and 6 elements per strophe, and mean strophe length of males during this period was highly repeatable. However, some males changed the range of strophe types produced and decreased their mean strophe length after unsuccessful breeding or spending long periods of time singing (unpaired males). These changes show that strophe length is phenotypically plastic, and suggest that singing long strophes is energetically more costly than singing short ones. The significant relationship between strophe length and body condition, and the fact that long strophes were associated with longer previous pauses than short strophes, also suggest that increasing strophe length is costly. All these findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that strophe length reflects male condition in the Hoopoe, although it is not clear what the actual cost of singing long strophes is.

In several passerine species it has been shown that strophe-length is a sexually selected trait that reflects male quality and correlates with reproductive success. Here we analyse whether in a non-passerine, the Hoopoe, strophe-length of males is correlated with several variables of their reproductive success. Females paired with males singing long strophes laid their first clutch earlier, produced larger first clutches and laid second clutches after a successful first one more frequently than those paired with males singing short strophes. Moreover, males with long strophes produced more fledglings in their first clutches and in the whole season, partly because they brought more food for the brood than males with short strophes. The relationships found are not mediated by age effects. Previously we have shown that Hoopoe females in the early spring are attracted preferentially to songs with long strophes. Here we show that males singing long strophes also obtain postpairing benefits in terms of reproductive success, and that females paired with these males obtain direct benefits because these males provide greater feeding effort in the second half of the nestling period. These findings support the hypothesis that in the Hoopoe, strophe-length is a sexually selected cue under direct selection.

Rana muscosa have declined throughout their range in the Sierra Nevada and restoration plans require information on their movement ecology. Our study indicates that R. muscosa had different movement patterns and habitat associations during the 1997 summer period (August and September) compared to October when winter dormancy began. In August, visual surveys found frogs in 10 of the 11 lakes in upper Dusy Basin. During August most tagged frogs moved little (mean movement 77 m over five day periods) and all were found in the lake or adjacent stream where they were originally tagged. During September, movement increased compared to August Frogs moved from the original capture lake mean distances of 145 m, and moved cumulative distances of 315-466 m. By October, frogs were again sedentary (mean distance moved 43 m) and frogs were found in three of the II lakes in the basin. Moreover, mean home ranges (adaptive kernel 90% contours) also were different throughout the summer and were highest for frogs tracked during September (5336.2 m(2)) compared to August (385 m(2)); and October (52.8 m(2)). Before this study it was assumed that R, muscosa over-wintered in the deepest portion of the lake. However, most lakes were frozen when our study ended, and tagged frogs were found nearshore under ledges and in deep underwater crevices suggesting that at least some R. muscosa over-winter in these nearshore areas. In this study, we found R. muscosa in different aquatic habitats over the course of their activity period and that they readily moved between these habitats using both aquatic and overland pathways. The movements appear to be associated with seasonal migrations between summer and over-wintering sites."

These sediments were deposited when the low-angle normal faults of two brittle extensional systems were active. The so-called Contraviesa system, with northward transport direction, is therefore Langhian, and the Filabres system, with southwestward transport, is Serravallian. The faults limit the Alpujarride and Malaguide extensional units and contributed to the rifting of the Alboran Domain.

Although having an anterior dorsocentral seta, which is a character of Chaetorellia, it is placed in Chaetostomella because of the shape of the male terminalia and the strong setae along the vibrissal angle. Its generic position is discussed. Campiglossa freidbergi sp. n. is described from high altitude in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Southern Spain. It belongs to the C. difficilis-group and differs from C. difficilis (Hendel) mainly in the wing pattern and details of the terminalia. Its hostplants are not known.

We compared seismic and soil penetration measurements of combined A + C and Cr horizon thickness, soil moisture and temperature, and stand variables in a contiguous 4-ha mixed-conifer stand of the Sierra Nevada. Thickness of A + C and Cr horizons were highly variable but were not correlated to each other. Total basal area and canopy cover were positively related with A + C horizon thickness, and shrub cover was positively related with Cr horizon thickness. Basal area of white fir [Abies concolor (Gord and Glend) Lindl.] and incense-cedar [Calocedrus decurrens (Torrey) Florin] were positively correlated with A + C horizon thickness, but there was no relationship between A + C or Cr horizon thickness and basal area of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. and Balf.), sugar pine (P. lambertiana Douglas), or red fir (A. magnifica A. Murray). Both white and red fir seedlings were associated with decreased soil temperature, but only white fir seedlings were positively associated with soil moisture. Soil penetration estimates of soil thickness were similar to seismic estimates for shallow soils (< 50 cm depth) but were poorly related on deeper soils. Visual surface conditions and tile probe estimates of soil thickness can be highly misleading because 'shallow' areas may have a thick layer of weathered bedrock that can serve as a potential rooting medium for deep-rooted trees and shrubs. In our study only the refraction seismic method had the potential to measure total soil depth that included A + C and Cr horizon thickness.

In an attempt to offset this lack of data, the present study provides information on different biochemical properties of soils from Sierra Nevada and Sierra Maria (southern Spain), covering a range of altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 m. In general, the values of the properties analyzed were similar to those of other mountain soils, although the values of basal respiration were particularly low, possibly due to the low levels of humidity at the time of sampling. The biochemical properties were closely correlated with each other, as observed in soils from other type of environments. Altitude had a clear effect on the biochemical properties because of its effect on climate and vegetation. At both sites, the soil samples showing the most homogenous pattern of biochemical properties (seen through star diagrams) were those corresponding to intermediate altitudes.

Scat analysis (n = 101 faeces; n = 402 prey items) showed that the diet is based on rodents, fundamentally wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, Mediterranean pine vole Microtus duodecimcostatus and south-western water vole Arvicola sapidus. Results showed strong differences between the two sites (chi(2) = 74.04, d.f. = 5, P < 0.001), that is a predominance of voles in the mesic Chico river, whereas mice are predominant in the xeric Tejos ravine. Red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa and carrion also played an important role, especially in biomass terms. The overall diet differed essentially from that of the Mediterranean region, which surrounds the study area, since in these areas rabbits constitute the primary prey. However, the diet of the mountain wildcats is similar to that in the Eurosiberian floral region, despite its distance from the Sierra Nevada. In conclusion, the Iberian wildcat seems to behave as a facultative specialist, since it prefers rabbits whenever they are available, but rodents constitute most of its diet if rabbits are scarce or absent."

SUBJECTS, PATIENTS AND METHODS: Contact tracing of the driver, 3 teachers and 49 students from different grades who were travelling from Malaga to Sierra Nevada (Spain) in March 1998. All the students from the ten grades where any case of tuberculosis appeared from April to December 1998 and all the teachers of the school were included. RESULTS: At the school, 232 students were studied, The prevalence of the infection was 35%, A total of 12 new cases among the students were found. No teachers out of the 127 examined became ill. Out of the people who travelled by shool bus, 2 teachers and 19 students were infected, prevalence among students 46%; five of those become ill. The odds ratio of infection for those having a class mate with positive smears was 5,5. On the other hand, the trip by bus (compared with those who did not take it) meant a odds ratio of 3,4. Most of the infected travellers were sitting in the bus close to the index case. CONCLUSIONS: In this tuberculosis outbreak some of the students who became ill or infected were not near the index case nor friendly with him at class.

The effect of climate variability on phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics and nutrient availability was studied in two high mountain fishless lakes (La Caldera and Rio Seco) of contrasting morphology, hydrology and dissolved inorganic nitrogen : soluble reactive phosphate (DIN : SRP) ratios during 1986 and after a 10-year-long drought in 1996 and 1997. 2. Thaw was delayed and water temperatures were lower in both lakes in 1996 than in 1986 and 1997. However, the lake-specific DIN : SRP ratio was maintained in the 3 years studied, reflecting its local control. 3. On other hand, the presumptive limiting nutrient in each lake, P in La Caldera and N in Rio Seco, showed higher concentrations in 1996 versus 1986 and 1997. Significant positive correlations between temperature and chlorophyll a were found in both lakes in 1996 but these relationships were negative or not significant in 1986 and 1997. Zooplankton biomass showed lower values in 1996 than in 1986 or 1997. 4. These findings can be explained by a decoupling of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction because of a constraint on zooplankton growth by low temperatures in the coldest year studied. This observation furnishes evidence that regional climatic control on the phytoplankton-zooplankton link can modulate the overall demand for nutrients.

Chlorophyll a, TN, and TP increased, whereas the TN:TP ratio fell substantially between the two periods, reaching values generally between 25 and 10 (by weight). On the contrary, DIN, SRP, and DIN:SRP ratios were similar for both periods in each lake. DIN:SRP ratios generally ranged from 5 to 20 (by weight). This ratio was low in the lakes with small catchment areas and increased progressively with catchment basin size. A regression analysis for the smallest catchments showed that chlorophyll a concentrations were not accounted for by variability in TP concentration. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the influence of episodes of Saharan dust, rich in P, reaching the Southern Mediterranean area.

A high frequency sampling program was developed simultaneously in two high mountain lakes: a shallow one, with daily large temperature changes but little surface-bottom temperature difference and a deeper one with more stable temperature but vertical heterogeneity in the water profile. Since the capacity of H. bulgarica to perform vertical migrations in these lakes of Sierra Nevada is already known, we have studied the relationship between egg ratios and chlorophyll-a concentration, mean temperatures and temperature instability (measured as the daily rate of temperature change - TCR - as well as the surface-bottom temperature difference - SBT -) in both lakes. Results show that the intensity of temperature fluctuations has a positive effect on the egg-ratios, as TCR is only correlated with that variable in the shallow lake and SBT is only correlated with egg-ratios in the deeper one.

In contrast, total nitrogen (TN) deposition was related to rainfall and did not follow the pattern observed for PM and TP. The molar TN: TP ratio was significantly lower (i.e., phosphorus-enriched) in dry deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 11.2) than in wet deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 95.5). In the study lakes, the molar TN: TP ratios and the Chl a concentrations were significantly influenced by the molar TN: TP ratio and the TP content of atmospheric deposition, respectively. Lake responses were more pronounced in the more phosphorous-limited system.

Recent changes in allometric relationships among morphological traits in the dipper (Cinclus cinclus)	Journal of Ornithology	 	2007	OCT	148	4	489	494	"allometry;Cinclus cinclus;climatic change;dipper;morphology;GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE;BODY-SIZE;BERGMANNS RULE;PASSERINE BIRDS;TEMPERATURE;CONSEQUENCES;POPULATIONS;BONFERRONI;EVOLUTION;GOSHAWKS;Zoology ER"	Organisms are responding to recent climate warming by changing different aspects of their biology, including morphology. The present work examines the way in which dipper (Cinclus cinclus) morphology has varied over the past 20 years (1985-2005) in Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). Tarsus length has decreased, but wing and tail length have increased in the same period. These opposite trends have provoked changes in the allometric relationships among the different parts of the body in the dipper. A decrease in body size is predicted by Bergmann's rule, and similar results have been found in other birds. However, although this study found a decrease in tarsus length, no change was found for body mass. The increase in wing and tail length may be related to a variation in the trophic niche in response to the decrease in water volume of rivers that occurred during the study period. Other studies show that the dipper's diet varies with water flow, and water flow has decreased in the study area as a consequence of climatic warming.

The Baetic ranges in Spain have such a large number of endemic plant taxa that the territory has been recognized as a well-defined biogeographical unit. These endemic taxa tend to concentrate on disjunct highland areas that have been described consequently as 'highland islands'. Despite the importance and complexity of these sites, the research carried out so far has produced only descriptive classifications. These approaches overlook the relationships between the sites and do not serve to identify the main centres of endemism. Herein, multivariate analysis techniques (cluster analysis and reciprocal averaging) and the parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), applied to the 222 orophilous endemic taxa of the Baetic ranges, have been used to reveal the floristic similarities between the areas involved, to identify the centres of endemism and to re-assess the previous classifications. Four centres of endemism are defined, one siliceous and three calcareous. The most outstanding feature in the Baetic ranges is precisely the floristic difference between siliceous and calcareous mountains. Calcareous territories extend along a SW-NE axis in line with the oceanic-continental gradient. The nature of the soil in the vast siliceous and calcareous-dolomitic territories of the Sierra Nevada is probably the cause of the remarkable floristic diversity. Not surprisingly, in our analysis these areas stand out as centres of endemism. We conclude that previous biogeographical classifications of the ranges are too rigid and do not properly reflect the floristic similarities of the area under study.

A rapid method for measuring K fixation could help clarify relationships with other soil properties, especially mineralogy. Our objectives were to compare some existing measurement techniques for soil K fixation and availability, develop an alternative K fixation test, and evaluate the utility of soil texture and parent material for predicting K fixation in soils derived from granitic Sierra Nevada (SN) and nongranitic Coast Range (CR) alluvium. Potassium pools were estimated by 1 mol L-1 NH4OAc and sodium tetraphenylboron (TPB) extractions. Our 1-h fixation method correlated well (R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.001) with a 7-d procedure, so the 1-h method was used for subsequent work. The SN soils fixed up to 740 mg K kg(-1); CR soils fixed up to 263 mg K kg-1. There was no significant relationship between K fixation and soil clay or silt content for either parent material. The TPB test had a stronger correlation with NH4OAc-extractable K in SN soils (R-2 = 0.77, P= 0.001) than in CR (R-2 = 0.49, P= 0.001). Plant-available nonexchangeable K (PANK = TPB minus NH4OAc) did not correlate with K fixation potential for pooled data from all pedons (R-2 < 0.11), and had negative correlation (R-2 from 0.97 to 0.99, P = 0.01) for individual pedons. The PANK probably represents K that has already been fixed and satisfies some of the K fixation capacity. The 1-h test is a reliable, rapid method for predicting K fixation potential. Together, the TPB and NH4OAc tests could be useful for identifying K already fixed by soils, thereby reducing K fixation potential."

Development of large north-facing folds and their relation to crustal extension in the Alboran domain (Alpujarras region, Betic Cordilleras, Spain)	Tectonophysics	Tectonophysics	1998	Nov-30	298	01-Mar	271	295	"extension;north-facing folds;Alboran domain;Alpujarras region;Betic Cordilleras;Spain;SOUTHERN SPAIN;TECTONIC EVOLUTION;SIERRA-NEVADA;METAMORPHIC ROCKS;RECUMBENT FOLDS;FAULT SYSTEMS;SE SPAIN;COMPLEX;NAPPE;DEFORMATION;Geochemistry & Geophysics ER"	Detailed research in the eastern part of the Alpujarras region, Betic Cordilleras, has revealed the existence of large recumbent fold structures involving lithological sequences previously considered to belong to different tectonic units. We have reconstructed a large, complex fold structure (which can be followed axially for over 50 km) based on a careful revision of the boundaries between lithological formations, a structural analysis of the carbonate and metapelite sequences, and the use of mineralogical techniques such as measurements of d(001) basal spacing of phengite, paragonite and chlorite, determinations of the illite 'crystallinity' index (IC) and b(0) parameters of mica and chlorite. Structural field data described in this paper include gently dipping axial plane cleavage surfaces, common occurrence of gently dipping boudinage and pinch-and-swell structures and associated sub-orthogonal stretching lineation, similarity in orientation of this stretching lineation with the slip direction of the low-angle normal faults, and close association between north-facing recumbent folds and top-to-the-north low-angle normal faults (the slip direction of the faults being broadly perpendicular to the fold axes). These features clearly indicate that extensional processes played a decisive role in the generation of the Alpujarras large recumbent folds. The development of these recumbent folds probably occurred during the Early to Middle Miocene extensional tectonics that affected the Betic Cordilleras. The formation of large-scale folds in association with normal faulting is consistent with the P-T paths and geochronological data established for the Alpujarride region.

The Lujar syncline and, probably, the associated recumbent anticline which crops out southeast of Sierra de Lujar show a great variation in the orientation of the hinge line. Although having a curved shape, the hinge line is contained in a plane whose attitude coincides with the main attitude of the axial-plane crenulation foliation (Sc), suggesting that it is a sheath fold. The strongly deformed overturned limb of the syncline is cut by two low-angle normal faults displacing towards the north. Similarity in the kinematics between the faults and the fold, and the association between the faults and the high-strain zone in the overturned limb of the fold, suggest that they are related. Regional constraints on the age of the crenulation cleavage and the low-angle normal faults indicate that they formed during the early Miocene late-orogenic extensional event in the Alboran Domain. We propose an alternate explanation for the structure of the Alpujarras region in which the Lujar syncline forms part of a recumbent syncline-anticline pair that extends along much of the Alpujarride outcrop in the southern Betic Cordillera. In several places, the fold is disrupted by low-angle normal faults, and it is overlain by an upper Alpujirride extensional sheet mainly composed of medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks. We suggest that all these structures arose from the extensional deformation under decreasing temperature conditions of a previously thickened and metamorphosed orogenic crust. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Channel fills, parallel lamination, cross-lamination, graded bedding, sedimentary clastic dykes and other sedimentary structures and features occur in the rauhwacke body. These sedimentary rocks correspond to continental deposits of alluvial and karstic origin deposited over a karstified erosional surface of Nevado-Filabride marbles. Although no fossils have been found in the rauhwackes, a Tortonian age for these rocks is suggested on the basis of structural arguments and lithostratigraphic data from the nearby Almanzora basin. The rauhwackes were buried by slabs of Alpujarride rocks that gravitationally slid over them during the uplifting of the Sierra de los Filabres.

Sex ratio (male : female) increased significantly with elevation, and above 2600 in it was significantly male-biased. The reproductive effort was markedly greater for females than for males at all elevations. However, over 3 years of study, the growth of the females, measured as elongation of the main axes, was similar to that of the males. In both sexes, growth decreased with increasing elevation. Neither size of the ripe seed cones, nor the number of developed seeds per cone varied with elevation. The percentage of filled seeds was significantly greater at higher elevations indicating more favourable conditions for wind pollination in these stands. However, cone production decreased with elevation and so, reproductive success of J. communis subsp. alpina in Sierra Nevada decreases towards both upper and lower altitudinal distribution limits.

The analysis of scats revealed a very important interspecific trophic niche overlap in the mesic habitat. In the xeric habitat the differences were significant and the overlap moderate. Seasonal variations existed in the degree of overlap, which reached its highest Level in winter in the mesic habitat and in spring in the xeric habitat. The results indicated that the availability of food in each habitat was important in determining the divergence of the diets. Thus, in the mesic habitat, competition could be possible, although it was not important enough to cause a habitat segregation. Martens seemed to be more adaptive than foxes, probably due to their smaller size and arboreal life, allowing them to exploit fruit which is not as profitable for the fox. Foxes based their diet on small mammals, carrion and cultivated fruit in both habitats. Rabbits were also seasonally important in the xeric habitat. The trophic niche breadth of foxes was higher in the mesic habitat. The inter-habitat comparison showed significant differences in the diet of martens. In the xeric habitat, martens centred their diet on small mammals and fruit of Juniperus phoenicea, Morus ulmifolius and Amelanchier ovalis, while in the mesic habitat their diet was very similar to that of foxes. The trophic niche breadth was higher in the xeric habitat than in the mesic. The habitat conditions particulary influenced the overlap of the diets and these variations were fundamentally caused by the different availability of small fruit.

There were differences in both the age and lithology of the bed-rock in the study area. The surface soil layer is primarily enriched with lead in relation to the bed-rock, but zinc, manganese, and cadmium also occur. Lead, zinc and cadmium concentrations show a decrease with increasing distance from the road, whereas the levels of iron, manganese, copper, nickel and chromium do not show such a variation. The change in lead and zinc concentrations with increasing distance from the road is related to the topography of the area immediately adjacent to the road. On the descending slopes the concentrations of these metals remain unchanged or increase with the increasing distance from the road, whereas on the ascending slopes they show a clear decrease.

For Chariklo, the absolute magnitudes determined from the February 2000 data are found to be higher by about 0.27 mag than the average in the 1999 run. This may indicate long period rotational variability and possibly a G parameter higher than the assumed value of 0.15. From the best sampled R-lightcurve obtained in the February 2000 run, no short term rotational variability was found. The V- R colours for this object in all runs are similar to previously published values. For 1999 UG(5), colours were found to be very red: B - V = 0.88 +/- 0.18, V - R = 0.60 +/- 0.08 and R- I = 0.72 +/- 0.13. These results place this object in the group of the reddest known bodies in the Solar System. H-R and H-V are found to be 10.06 +/- 0.09 and 10.61 +/- 0.07 respectively, and its diameter is estimated to be on the order of 47 +/- 2 km.

Teladorsagia circumcincta and Marshallagia marshalli were the most abundant abomasal species, whereas N. abnormalis, N. davtiani, and N. oiratianus were dominant in the small intestine. Counts of both abomasal and intestinal nematodes were generally low (year-round-median = 292 and 94 worms, respectively), and significantly lower numbers of M. marshalli, N. davtiani, and N. oiratianus were found in summer. No sex-related differences in helminth abundance were found, but young ibex harbored significantly more N. davtiani and N. oiratianus than adults.

Results of these laboratory experiments were related to previous field data. Massive release and detachment of zoospores, which is the dispersal stage of the epibiont, occurred just before molting. A lower number of zoospores was dispersed from the discarded molts and a scant number dispersed during the intermolt period. Release of cysts, which is the overwintering stage of the epibiont, mainly occurred immediately after the molt was discarded. The production of dispersal forms (zoospores and cysts) shows precise temporal synchronization with the molting process in Daphnia. The colonization of uninfected individuals from infected molts and from infected individuals was rapid. Our results suggest that colonization of field animals in this lake is efficient and is facilitated by the coincident aggregates of substrate and epibiont.

Imaging spectroscopy of selected regional dark mantle deposits of the Moon	Planetary and Space Science	Planet.Space Sci.	2001	APR	49	5	487	500	"LUNAR;SYSTEM;Astronomy & Astrophysics ER"	We present the study of four surface units previously identified as dark mantle deposits on the Moon: Taurus Littrow. Sulpicius Gallus, Mare Vaporum and Rima Bode deposits. The data have been obtained at the 1.5 m telescope of Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain) by using an imaging spectrometer working in the 0.3-1.0 um spectral range. Principal features of these geologic units are: (a) low albedo, (b) localization at the boundaries between highlands and maria, and (c) spectral properties similar to those of the associated mare lavas. The image cubes have been processed by means of two independent statistical methods: the principal components analysis and a supervised clustering technique (spectral angle mapper). Using these methods it has been possible to identify the areas covered by dark mantling material and to compare the different spectral properties of the four deposits. In particular, two different classes of the dark mantle deposits have been detected on the basis of the spectra. New areas in Sulpicius Gallus deposit having intermediate spectral behavior between highland soil and dark mantling material have been identified, probably due to a mixing of the two terrains.

Some aspects of the functioning of careos determined by tracer experiments: Example of La Alpujarra (Spain)	 	 	1997	 	 	 	434	 	"Engineering;Environmental Sciences & Ecology;Geology;Water Resources ER"	Since Moorish times (from the eighth to the fifteenth century), and possibly much earlier (the Roman Empire), there has existed, on the southern edge of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), a noteworthy technique of artificial recharge, known as careos''. This consists of the diverting of snowmelt to a series of sites with great infiltration capacity, where the water percolates to a greater or lesser extent. A traces test was performed at a careo site and control points at the known springs located downstream. The calculated transient time varied from one spring to another. As expected, it was not possible to recover all of the tracer, and there were discovered to be various flow paths through the aquiferous material, as shown by the form of the tracer recovery curve, which presented more than one peak.

This practice, known as cal eos, constitutes an ancient example of artificial recharge. The objective is to guarantee a supply of drinking water during the dry months, as well as improve the physicochemical characteristics of the water. In addition, this system helps maintain moisture in the immediate environment, and thus has a positive effect on local vegetation.

The taxonomy, distribution and habitat preferences of Chironomus larvae from profundal benthos of reservoirs and natural lakes in Spain are presented. The 114 water bodies studied were medium to large reservoirs and lakes throughout Spain, and were visited on at least two occasions (summer and winter). Out of the natural lakes investigated, Chironomus larvae were found only in one karstic lake (Banyoles), and to date, these have not been found in the high mountain lakes of the Spanish Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada, or in Spain's largest oligotrophic lake (Sanabria). 2. Multiple regression with environmental data from reservoirs showed that the density of Chironomus larvae was inversely correlated with water depth, temperature and sulphide content of the bottom water, but positively correlated with alkalinity and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content of bottom water. Thus, the density of Chironomus larvae was higher in shallow reservoirs from the eastern part of Spain (calcareous water and higher PON), but markedly lower in southern reservoirs (higher temperature and higher sulphide). 3. According to morphological and cytological characteristics, three species of this genus have been identified in the samples examined: C. bernensis, C. plumosus and C. nuditarsis. Reasons for the absence of other widespread European species are discussed. 4. Using canonical correspondence analysis to relate species and environmental variables, C. bernensis showed a significant preference for reservoirs with higher oxygen concentrations in bottom water and lower total reactive phosphorus (TRP) content at the surface than those reservoirs where C. plumosus-type were found. This suggests that the smaller C. bernensis prefers mesotrophic reservoirs and the larger C. plumosus-type (C. plumosus + C. nuditarsis) prefers eutrophic reservoirs. Taking into account the TRP/depth index for those samples collected at depths below the thermocline, and thus, where oxygen can be a limiting factor, C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis were present in reservoirs in which the index was low ( 1:800 for C. nuditarsis), while C. plumosus thrived in reservoirs with higher index values (< 1:20). These differences may reflect the preference of C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis for detrital material, while C. plumosus prefers phytoplankton. These observations are in agreement with the depth distribution of each species: C. plumosus was restricted to reservoirs less than 46 m deep, whereas the other two species (i.e. C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis) were found up to depths of 65 and 80 m, respectively. 5. Data from a transect (5-20 m deep) in Lake Banyoles are consistent with the general pattern described in reservoirs. In this lake, a high density of C. bernensis was recorded from littoral and sublittoral areas with abundant oxygen (above or close to the thermocline), whereas C. plumosus was scarce in several parts of the lake, especially in oxygen-deficient areas during the summer. This karstic, oligotrophic lake has a low TRP/depth index, and therefore, we expected C. bernensis to be dominant in the littoral, as is the case. Nevertheless, the severe depletion of oxygen caused by meromixis, and the high hydrogen sulphide concentration benefit C. plumosus in deeper zones. Chironomus nuditarsis was scarce in Lake Banyoles and only found at considerable depths.

Both interactions are influenced by zooplankton activity. To examine the relationship between algae and bacteria in Lake La Caldera, we studied: the correlations among phytoplankton, bacteria and phosphorus (P) dynamics; the ratio of organic carbon supplied by algae to organic carbon demand by bacteria; and the importance of P remineralized by metazooplankton for both communities. Phytoplankton and bacteria had a similar seasonal dynamics, and there was a significant and positive relationship between bacterial abundance and algal biomass (P < 0.01). However, the release of organic carbon from phytoplankton was usually higher than the bacterioplankton carbon requirement. P available via zooplankton remineralization satisfied between 74 and 316% of the minimum P demands of algae and bacteria. To elucidate whether zooplankton operate similarly on algae and bacterial growth or indirectly influence bacterial growth through phytoplankton metabolism, we performed zooplankton manipulation experiments. High zooplankton biomass in these experiments stimulated both primary and bacterial production, but release of organic carbon from phytoplankton declined. These results suggest a direct stimulus of bacterial growth, so algae and bacteria can balance grazing losses by compensatory growth. Further, the algal decrease of the organic carbon supply for bacteria could, over time, lead to a change in the algae-bacteria interaction from competition to commensalism. This reduction in organic carbon excretion could affect the balance of the competitive interaction."	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0142-7873	 	"UNIV GRANADA,DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL,E-18071 GRANADA,SPAIN.

The phytoplankton community (made up of green algae and chrysophyceae) reached a biovolume-density of 206 . 10(3) mum3 ml-1 at the beginning of the ice-free period, followed by a continual decrease. This community developed in limiting nutrient conditions (mainly P.). The population of green algae suffered a fungal epidemic after the ice melt which lasted approximately three weeks. Oocystis lacustris CHOD, showed a loss rate due to parasitism between 0.002 and 0.42 d-1, which amounts to up to 58 % of the total losses of this population, whereas the losses of Chlorella sp. were unimportant (> 3.5 . 10(-3) d-1).

In the 27 km 2 Ri o Torrente catchment, Sierra Nevada, southern Spain, rapid base- level fall has triggered knickpoint migration up both trunk and tributary channels, resulting in two distinct geomorphic zones: ( 1) a steep lower catchment with concordant rates of hillslope erosion and channel incision over both short ( 100 years: 5 - 8 mm yr(-1)) and medium ( 12 ka: 5 +/- 1 mm yr(-1)) timescales and ( 2) a low- relief soil- mantled upland topography with uniformly low bedrock and hillslope erosion rates ( 0.05 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1)). The uniformity of erosion in this upland surface indicates that catchment topography was previously in steady state. Rapid river incision below the channel knickpoints has resulted in the development of steep landslide-dominated hillslopes that are essentially "" tracking'' the incising channel. The magnitude of base- level fall required to generate these steep hillslopes is > 100 m; at least 50 m of this base- level fall occurred during the past similar to 21 ka. These steep hillslopes are eroding back into the low- angled upland surface at a much slower rate than the channel knickpoint. Consequently, the trunk channel knickpoint has already reached the catchment headwaters while hillslopes continue to adjust to the new base level, indicating that the channel profile will regain equilibrium form long before hillslopes. Thus hillslopes are the limiting factor for the duration of landscape transience in this small mountain catchment."

Major contrasts in the denudation history are recorded within the 27 km(2) Rio Torrente catchment. Upland areas are characterized by low-relief, low slope angles, and locally the preservation of shallow marine sediments, which have experienced 2 km of denudation since circa 4 Ma. The minimum denudation rates of 0.4 mm yr(-1) derived from AFT also contrast with the slow medium-term (10(4) years) erosion rates (0.044 +/- 0.015 mm yr(-1)) estimated from (10)Be measurements at high elevations. The local medium-long-term contrasts in denudation rates within the high Sierra Nevada indicate that much of the unroofing occurs by tectonic denudation on flat-lying detachments. In lower elevation parts of the catchment, rapid river incision coupled to rock uplift has produced similar to 1.6 km of relief, implying that the rivers and adjacent hillslopes close to the edge of the orogen are sensitive to normal-fault-driven changes in base level. However, these changes are not transmitted into the low-relief slowly eroding upland areas. Thus the core of the mountain range continues to increase in elevation until the limits of crustal strength are reached and denudation is initiated along planes of structural weakness.

We use simple modelling to quantify the effect of particle spalling and/or landsliding on erosion rates determined using a cosmogenic in-situ produced isotope. Analytical results show that the cosmogenic nuclide concentration of a surface experiencing regular detachment of a grain or block may be considered to be in steady state, and 'in-situ' erosion rates estimated, when an appropriate number of spatially independent samples are amalgamated. We present equations that enable calculation of the number of bedrock samples that must be amalgamated for the estimation of mean erosion rates on an outcrop experiencing regular detachment of a grain or chip of thickness L every T years. Our findings confirm that mean catchment erosion rates may be reliably estimated from ""Be concentrations in fluvial sediment in high-relief rapidly eroding terrain. These catchment-wide integrated erosion rates can be calculated where erosion is primarily accomplished through shallow ( 3 m) landslides are the dominant mode of erosion only minimum erosion rates can be determined. Lastly, we present erosion rate measurements from the Torrente catchment that reveal variation of two orders of magnitude (0(.)03-1(.)6 m ka(-1)) quantifying the high degree of spatial variation in erosion rates expected within rapidly uplifting catchments.

The subsections comprising high altitude taxa are: subsect. Gymnocarpae, subsect. Fruticulosae; subsect. Hyssopifoliae, subsect. Luridae; subsect. Borgiae and subsect. Aranensis. Most of the high altitude taxa of section Sideritis are endemics with small distribution areas; they are incompletely known and threatened with extinction. The upper altitude limit of this section is attained at over 3000 m in Sierra Nevada (Spain) by Sideritis glacialis Boiss., which has been included in subsect. Fruticulosae Obon and D. Rivera. The taxonomy of this complex group of high altitude endemic taxa of Sideritis subsection Fruticulosae is discussed on the basis of macromorphological and micro-morphological characters. These are used in identification keys and for analysis of dissimilarity. The different habitats, allied species and plant communities are described.

In the Granada basin, according to the interpretation of the seismic profiles and results of the backstripping analysis, subsidence and sedimentation rates were at a maximum in the late Tortonian and decreased progressively; meanwhile, the neighbouring areas were uplifted forming important relief. Chronostratigraphical revisions of the marine sediments show that the marine incursion that deposited sediments in the Granada basin lasted only 1.3 Ma, between 8.5 and 7.2 Ma. The gradual retreat of the sea in the Granada basin is not attributable to global eustatic fluctuations, but rather to uplift in the Sierra Nevada and its adjacent areas. From latest Tortonian to early Messinian times, the region became continental and the Granada basin acquired its present physiography and was differentiated as such. From the late Tortonian onwards, NNW-SSE compression combined with ENE-WSW extension affected the cordillera. In the Granada basin, extension controlled fault movements. There are two well-defined fault sets: the first trends 70 degrees N-90 degrees E, with low angle faults (less than 30 degrees) dipping towards the north and south, defining the subsiding areas which have approximately E-W direction; whereas the second set has a NW-SE direction, and cuts and displaces the previous ones, defining the main subsiding areas in the eastern part of the basin. The reinterpretation of seismic profiles reveals that the subsiding axes within the Granada basin persisted from the Tortonian to the present because of continued displacements of the main faults."

We studied the strategy used by Rossomyrmex minuchae queens to invade their host Proformica longiseta. Field observations revealed that queens enter the host nest unchallenged by the host workers in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Pre-usurpation queens were found to possess a highly inflated Dufour's gland, which considerably reduces in size after successful usurpation. Chemical analysis of these queen glands revealed tetradecanal to be the major product in pre-usurpation Rossomyrmex queens, but to be almost absent in queens that have been adopted by P. longiseta. We consequently hypothesized that tetradecanal is a repellent that is used by queens to prevent host worker aggression. We tested its repellent effect by attempting to deter starved, highly motivated workers from a droplet of honey. Tetradecanal indeed proved to be highly repellent both to host worker P. longiseta and non-host worker Formica selysi. It was even more powerful than limonene, a reported general ant repellent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that R. minuchae queens use Dufour's gland secretion as a weapon during nest usurpation. The general use of tetradecanal as a defensive compound, and its seemingly non-specific repellent effect on ants, indicate that it may act as a general ant repellent. Its adoption by R. minuchae queens thus provides them with an efficient defensive and offensive chemical weapon during their long and risky search for new host nests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The mating behaviour of the entire genus Rossomyrmex is virtually unknown. We present here the results of a 3-year study of mating behaviour in R. minuchae. Behavioural observations and limited nest excavations revealed that R. minuchae does not produce sexuals every year, the number of sexuals is low, and the sex ratio tends to be female biased. Females typically exhibit two distinct activity periods. The first, the mating period, takes place in early afternoon: the ants ""call"" near the natal nest, mate and then return to their nest. The second, the dispersal period takes place in late afternoon: the mated females exit their nest and fly in search of a new, non-parasitized Proformica longiseta host nest. Males are highly active during the mating period, but will remain inactive in the dispersal period even if experimentally presented with virgin females. It appears that females are monogamous, while males are polygamous. When males are late arriving at the female calling site, the females will frequently congregate presumably calling in chorus. The low reproductive efficiency exhibited by R. minuchae, coupled with the postulated low genetic variation in the population, as sisters may mate with the same male, could result in a low survival rate and risk of eventual extinction. The observed decrease in nest density we observed during the 2004 season may be indicative of such a process."

La Caldera is used here as a prototypical example of small high-mountain lakes. Our results demonstrate that transport and mixing in small high-mountain lakes are shaped by the severe changes exhibited at diurnal time scales by the heat fluxes through the air-water interface, strong winds of episodic nature (storms), and the limited horizontal and vertical length scale of the basin. The thermal structure during the cooling phase of the ice-free period undergoes episodic changes that occur at short-time scales, driven by the strong winds with speeds of 15 m s(-1) and higher. During those storms, horizontal and vertical mixing and transport is predominantly driven by wind. During inter-storm periods, the oscillatory nature of the air-water heat exchange at diurnal time scales drives convective circulation, which for a small lake occurs at the basin scale and becomes the dominant mechanism of horizontal transport.

For the first time, a geodetic network along the Padul fault and two levelling profiles (Genil and Viznar) crossing the Granada fault were operated to detect crust micro-deformations in this area. Three years of terrestrial geodetic measurements are analysed to characterize the behaviour of these faults in a low to moderate strain rate environment. After the comparison of these three campaigns, we can conclude that there is no significant short-term movement of the Padul fault. Granada fault measurements show significant differences between 1999 and 2001 campaigns in Viznar profile. However, more data are needed to correlate this displacement to the tectonic activity.

The plant communities of the high reaches present greater specific richness and diversity (S(mean) = 7.0 +/- 3.4 and H'(mean) = 2.0 +/- 0.7) than do those of the middle and low reaches (S(mean) = 4.5 +/- 1.6 and H'(mean) = 1.8 +/- 0.6). One zone reached the highest specific richness (S = 12, H' = 3.2), which, apart from being situated in the intermediate stretch of the basin. represents a transitional state (ecotone) between the Salix and Tamarix communities. The characteristics of the waters analyzed indicate very high rates of erosion and runoff due to the nature of the soils (easily eroded marls) and to agricultural expansion and mining since the 16th century. The present-day riparian vegetation is not adequate to absorb the nitrates added to the basin by crop fertilization, reaching extremely high values, particularly during the dry period (between 1.2 and 42.5 mg/liter). Sewage dumping at three sampling stations did not appear to affect the specific composition of the woody vegetation, in the zones with watercourses, water salinity was low during the period of greater water flow, but considerably higher in the dry season (the upper limit was some 1.2 mS/m), resulting in a predominance of salt cedars over willows. Three types of saltcedar areas were distinguished: subhalophilous, which barely changes its chemical composition over the season; halophilous, which develops over strongly mineralized waters and markedly alters in chemical composition during the dry season; and hyperhalophilous, where salinity is extraordinarily high and quite constant throughout the year. A direct relationship was found between the dominance of Tamarix africana and abundance of NaCl."

R-mode factor analysis was used to relate results of the soil survey with those of the soil evaluation. We studied the area of the Sierra Nevada mountains in southern Spain. Soil variables were measured in 163 soil profiles, collected in a survey of the two soil environments of the Sierra Nevada: the calcareous and silicic zones. Four factor analyses showed that sand, clay, gravel and organic carbon content, and pH were the most useful soil characteristics in evaluating site keys that affect tree and shrub growth (nutrient availability, rooting space and soil water availability). In the calcareous zone, hue, value and chroma color, and pH, were easily determined soil characteristics that established and classified the suitability of forest sites. In the silicic zone, hue, value and chroma, and altitude were the characteristics found most useful in evaluating forest sites.

The soils (Entic Cryumbrept, Typic Xerochrept, Pachic Cryoboroll and Typic Cryorthent) showed mineralogical discontinuities, exchangeable Ca:Mg ratios greater than 1 and a pH and base saturation profile that decreases in the central and lower parts of the solum. The different soil particle-size fractions had similar mineral compositions (X-ray diffraction [XRD] acid infrared [IR] techniques) retaining unstable phases (amphibole, feldspar, serpentine). Inherited or slightly transformed phyllosilicates (serpentine, mica, chlorite, talc and interstratified phases) were shown to be dominant in the clay fraction. The scant pedogenic evolution contrasted with a high free iron content. The concentrations in fine earth of DTPA-Zn, -Cu, -Mn, -Co, -Cr, -Ni and -Fe were not toxic, showed interdependence and were related to the silt, clay and free forms content. The gravel fraction revealed significant amounts of free iron and available microelements (DTPA-extractable), which could be bound to deposits of precipitated secondary forms and to finer pedogenic material present in the fragments. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations confirmed these morphological characteristics in serpentinite and amphibolite pebbles.

Spain) record the high-pressure dehydration of antigorite-olivine serpentinite to form chlorite harzburgite (ol + opx + chl). In the field, these two rock types are separated by a well-defined isograd. Titanian clinohumite (TiCl) and olivine show textural and compositional differences depending on the rock type. OH-TiCl occurs in the serpentinite as disseminated grains and in veins. F-OH-TiCl is observed exclusively in the chlorite harzburgite, where it occurs as porphyroblastic grains and within prograde olivine as irregular and lamellar, planar intergrowths at microscopic and submicroscopic scales. Petrological evidence of partial to complete breakdown of TiCl to olivine + ilmenite is preserved in both rock types. Chlorite harzburgite is characterized by a brown pleochroic olivine with abundantally oriented microscopic to submicroscopic oxide particles. The mean Ti-content of the brown olivine is 144 ppm. The brown olivine preserves TiCl lamellae that sometimes grade into ghost lamellae outlined by the oxide trails. This observation suggests that some of the oxide inclusions in the brown olivine are derived from the breakdown of TiCl intergrowths. Thermodynamic modelling of selected Almirez bulk rock compositions indicates a temperature increase from 635 degrees C to 695 degrees C, at pressures ranging from 1.7 GPa to 2.0 GPa, as the cause for the compositional adjustment of TiCl between the Almirez antigorite serpentinite and chlorite harzburgite. These P-T estimates are in good agreement with the sequence of phase relations observed in the field. The computed phase diagrams in conjunction with the geothermal conditions envisaged for different subduction settings indicate that TiCl is stable in the vicinity of the antigorite serpentinite/chlorite harzburgite phase boundary in some subduction settings. In these circumstances, clinohumite-olivine intergrowths in chlorite harzburgite may act as a sink for high field strength elements, and probably other elements, that are present in the mantle-wedge fluids.

Five of the 10 female ibex showed ovulatory activity with a mean (+/- s.e.m.) duration of the oestrous cycle of 19.4 +/- 1 days (range: 17-23 days). On average, the five cyclic females weighed 28 +/- 10.9 kg. Progesterone cycles occurred only in animals older than 4 years of age. Ovulatory activity extended from December to January. The duration of the breeding season was 43.2 +/- 17.7 days. Ibex females younger than 4 years of age had a body weight lower (P < 0.01) than that of adults and none of them displayed ovulations. Plasma concentrations of prolactin levels were significantly affected by season (P < 0.05), following a trend that was roughly parallel to daylength. The highest values occurred in the spring (119.7 +/- 21.4 ng.mL (1)) and the summer (139.3 +/- 19.8 ng.mL (1)), the lowest values in the autumn (26 +/- 7.4 ng.mL (1)) and in the winter (19.7 +/- 3.2 ng.mL (1)). Our results showed a very restricted breeding season, despite the fact that the Spanish ibex originates from and lives in a temperate latitude, revealing a remarkably good adaptation to the harsh climatic and nutritional conditions of their mountainous habitat.

The results of our analysis indicate that cryoclastic and thermoclastic processes, along with chemical weathering, are the main factors controlling rock degradation. Microscale features observed in primary minerals and parent rock fabrics, such as structural discontinuities, cleavage planes, fracturing patterns, and variations in chemical composition, play important roles in triggering weathering and, given sufficient time, progressively lead to grussification and soil development. Exfoliation, hydration, and splitting apart of biotite, as well as hydrolysis and etching of plagioclase and K-feldspar, appear to be prominent factors in the breakdown of bedrock. Whereas time controls the degree of development of the main weathering features and climate influences type and intensity of the dominant processes, relief strongly influences the development and preservation/removal of the regolith/soil cover. Geomorphological evidence of severe surface erosion is quite good, especially along steep slopes where weathering products are quickly removed, although on the highest, dissected paleosurfaces (the oldest paleolandscape remnants in the Sila Massif), wide boulder fields represent relics of past, deep spheroidal weathering that have been exhumed by intense erosion. Erosive, depositional, or reworking phenomena, often enhanced by human activity, are well recorded by macro- and micromorphological features of soils, which show simple, poorly differentiated, rejuvenated profiles, buried or truncated horizons, abundant coarse-grained primary minerals or rock fragments, and pedorelicts. The soil clay mineralogy, characterized by illite, chlorite, and vermiculite, and the dominance of coarse textures confirm a young pedogenetic stage of evolution, although highly weathered sand grains (quartz included) occur in rarely preserved mature paleosols. This interpretation is also consistent with the compositional immaturity of fluvial sands, which have undergone low to moderate transport.

After collection, the batches were stored singly in test tubes closed with foam stoppers under laboratory conditions at 20-25 degrees C. The number of eggs in each egg-batch varied between 37 and 312 and the length of the batches between 0.6 and 4.2 cm. Independently of the pine species infested, seven to nine rows of eggs were counted, wrapped around one pair of needles. A correlation was found between number of eggs and the product of number of egg rows and length of egg-batches (82% < r(2) < 97%). Oviposition almost always started from the base towards the tip of the needles. The egg parasitoids that emerged were counted daily, removed and identified. Later in the year of oviposition, after the end of the period of emergence of the parasitoids, the scale cover of the egg-batches were removed. One year later, all eggs were opened and the contents, such as parasitoid meconia and remains of caterpillars, were determined. The hatching rate of the caterpillars varied from 47.2 to 79.7%. The rate of parasitism fluctuated between 11.3 and 31.7%, but 44% of parasitoids died before successful emergence. Four species of Chalcidoidea were identified: Baryscapus servadeii (Dom.), Ooencyrtus pityocampae (Mercet), Anastatus bifasciatus (Fonsc.) and Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii and O. pityocampae the most abundant species, followed by Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii emerged mainly in June and O. pityocampae in April or June, depending on the region. For A. bifasciatus only males, and for B. servadeii females emerged except one male. In O. pityocampae, a relatively high percentage of males (5.4-10.4%) was found.

Climatic and human influence on river systems and glacier fluctuations in southeast Spain since the Last Glacial Maximum	Quaternary International	 	2002	 	93-4	 	85	100	"SOIL;Physical Geography;Geology ER"	The semi-desert environments of the Mediterranean re-ion are most sensitive to climatic changes and human land exploitation. This paper is focused on the Late Pleistocene and Holocene geomorphic evolution of southeast Spain, one of the driest regions in Europe. Late Pleistocene and Holocene chronosequences of river terraces were established for the Antas and Aguas valleys, respectively. The deposition of tip to four fluvial terraces during isotope stage 2 points to important erosion and accumulation processes at the end of Late Pleistocene in the Vera basin. In contrast to the stage 2 deposits, the Holocene terraces are composed of point bar deposits accumulated by meandering rivers with less sediment discharge. According to the obtained C-14-dating and extracted pottery fragments, Holocene terrace deposition occurred during the Atlantic period, early Middle Ages, Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century. The most outstanding site in southern Spain for studying Holocene glacier shifts (up to five end-moraines) is the Veleta cirque in Sierra Nevada, where the southernmost glacier of Europe persisted during the Little Ice Age. The climate changes of the LIA probably are recorded by two glacier fluctuations, as indicated by Pb-210 dating and historical data. The reconstruction of the evolution of the Aguas and Antas valleys stress that the aggradations of the lower terraces is mostly climate-induced although during the last 500 years, human interference in the landscape (Christian conquest, mining boom of the 19th century, etc.) may have played an important role to river dynamics.

Particularly, evolution towards complex social systems in ants affects how individuals move in space, usually by making females philopatric. Proformica longisetais well-suited for studying the effects of female philopatry, because female sexuals are wingless and do not actively disperse. We studied genetic population structure in P. longiseta in local scale both as genetic viscosity within one subpopulation, and as differentiation between closely (0.1-1.5 km) located subpopulations, by using nuclear (microsatellites) and mitochondrial (SSCP) markers. Dependent colony founding by splitting old nests is the only known nest founding strategy in P. longiseta. However, no genetic viscosity was detected at the nuclear markers within the subpopulation studied, possibly due to the dynamic nature of P. longiseta populations. The extreme female philopatry showed as strong structure between closely located subpopulations in the mitochondrial genome, but there was no isolation by distance showing that the differentiation pattern was random. Genetic structure in the nuclear genome was much weaker, and there was an indication of isolation by distance. This suggests that male dispersal is strong but not totally free across the area. Finally, non-dispersing P. longiseta females necessarily mate locally raising the possibility of inbreeding, but inbreeding coefficients showed that mating is random.

Sierra Nevada (S Spain) is a unique mountain massif within the high-mountain systems of the Mediterranean. It is of great floristic importance and very rich In endemic species. However, it. requires numerous tasks for restoring plant cover due to the constant anthropic degradation, especially because of the ski station located near the second-highest peak of the mountain. One of the restoration efforts consists of trying to reproduce, in the laboratory, the ideal conditions to pre-germinate seeds of some of the species most threatened by these perturbations. This is to transplant the seedlings afterwards in the mountain, thereby contributing to the recovery of these species. With this purpose, a germination experiment was performed, under controlled conditions, with seeds of Genista versicolor Boiss. Hormathophylla spinosa (L.) P. Kupfer, Reseda complicata Bory, and Thymus serpylloides Bory. These four species, native to the Mediterranean high mountains, were germinated under constant darkness, 12 or 24 h light followed by constant darkness, and constant light, at temperatures of 1.5 degrees C or 25 degrees C. The germination process was monitored during 15 days. Results were species-dependent: some species germinated easier under darkness at low temperatures, such as Genista versicolor, whereas Thymus serpylloides presented maximum germination under constant light to a higher temperature.

Theatops erythrocephalus (C. L. Koch) occurs along the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea in the Balkan Peninsula. and in coastal Spain and Portugal. The other four species - T. posticus (Say), T. spinicaudus (Wood), T. phanus Chamberlin, and T. californiensis Chamberlin - occur in the United States and northwestern Mexico. Theatops posticus occupies a broad area east of the Central Plains from Connecticut and southern New York to the south Florida keys and eastern Texas; an allopatric western population extends from southwestern New Mexico and western Chihuahua to the southern Great Basin, the California desert east of the Sierra Nevada, the Pacific Ocean in Baja California Norte, the Channel Islands off the southern California coast, and the eastern slope of the Coast Range near the latitude of San Francisco Bay. Theatops spinicaudus occurs sympatrically with T. posticus in two areas of the east; the inner surfaces of its caudal legs possess variable series of ridges and teeth. Theatops phanus occurs in epigean and subterranean environments in southern Texas and extends from east of highway I-35 to west of the Pecos River; the inner surfaces of its caudal legs also possess variable series of ridges and teeth. The distribution of T. californiensis, anatomically convergent with T. erythrocephalus, is as described previously, but locality information is detailed, as only one site, the type locality, is currently known. Relationships among the plutoniuminine species are postulated as P. zwierleini + (T. spinicau-dus + (T. phanus + (T. erythrocephalus +(T. posticus + T. californiensis)))).

These cold episodes alternated with the ones characterized by landscape stability and soil formation. Twelve soils that were formed on pre-glacial surfaces and glacial deposits of various ages were studied in four sectors: Laguna Seca, Lanjaron Valley, Mulhacen Valley, and Corral del Veleta. The soil parent material in all of these sectors was mica schist. Organic matter content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable bases, saturation degree, and pH, were found to be not correlated with the age of the surface. The macromorphological differentiation of the soils, their clay and Fe-d contents, and especially, the clay and iron oxide accumulation indices, increased with the relative age of the surface. In contrast, the Fe-o content and the Fe-o:Fe-d ratio diminished with the age of the surface. During the last few pedogenic episodes, soils were formed by strong leaching and acidification, but with very little chemical weathering. All of these features suggest that climatic shifts during the pedogenic episodes towards conditions less favourable to soil development, in addition to vegetation changes and disturbances on the soil surfaces, which started by periglacial processes, account for the soil evolution of the Sierra Nevada better than time as the only variable factor. The soils did not develop monotonically with time and the sequence of surfaces cannot be regarded in a strict sense as a chronosequence. The soils developed over a series of stepped pedogenic episodes; in each episode, especially in the oldest, the properties of the soils related to weathering could have approached or reached a steady state. Nevertheless, when these properties are plotted against time, a continued increase in soil development results. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Three major mitotypes (designated a, b and d) were detected. Within Spain all mitotypes were found, gene diversity was high, H-T = 0.586, and this diversity was distributed predominantly among rather than within populations (F-ST(M) = 0.813 for the seven Spanish populations). Mitotype d was present only in the most southerly population from the Sierra Nevada. Elsewhere in Europe, populations showed little or no mtDNA diversity within regions, but there were marked differences between regions. Italian populations were fixed for mitotype b; populations from northern France, Germany, Poland, Russia and southern Sweden were fixed for mitotype a; while populations in northern Fennoscandia were fixed for mitotype b. The isolated Scottish populations were predominantly of mitotype a, but mitotype b was present in three of the 20 populations scored. In Scotland, UK gene diversity (H-T = 0.120) and genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST(M) = 0.37) was much lower than in Spain. When interpreted in the light of complementary data from pollen analysis and nuclear genetic markers, the results suggest that present-day populations of P. sylvestris in western Europe have been derived from at least three different sources after glaciation."

However, the sex responsible for egg ejection and whether eggs are grasped or punctured are two essential questions that remain unanswered for most host species. In this paper, by filming the behaviour of individuals of three different species confronted with a foreign egg experimentally introduced into their nests, we first determine the relationship between recognition (when the birds aggressively pecked the experimental egg) and ejection. Secondly, we demonstrate that in the species where only the female incubates, only the female recognizes and ejects the model egg, whereas in the two species where both sexes incubate, both sexes eject the foreign egg. Finally, the large host species ejected the model egg by grasping it with the bill, whereas the two small species ejected it by puncturing it first. Furthermore, our data suggest that puncture ejection is more costly than grasping ejection considered both in terms of energetic and ejection costs.

The study was carried out in the Ojen-Marbella region where the Ojen and Los Reales nappes of the Alpujarride Complex outcrop. Ar-40/Ar-39 single-grain analyses of muscovite and biotite display plateau ages of 19 Ma, on the same rocks, Apatite fission-track datings give ages of 18-16 Ma for the last step of cooling below 110 degrees C, and confined track measurements indicate a very rapid cooling between 110 degrees and <60 degrees C. The combination of both data suggests a fast cooling phase at 19-16 Ma with a gradient higher than 100 degrees C/Ma between 500 +/- 50 degrees C and <60 degrees C. This fast cooling was associated with extensional tectonics accommodating thinning of the metamorphic alpine-type pile of nappes, The exhumation rate ranges from 1 to 3 km/Ma during the 19-18 Ma interval and is close to 1 km/Ma in the 18-16 Ma interval. Moreover an uplift of the Ojen and Los Reales units began after the Early Pliocene (5 Ma). The sediments sealing the strike-slip contact forming the boundary between the Alpujarride Complex and the Neomumidian Formation of Early Miocene age contain Early Pliocene planktonic foraminiferal assemblages (Zone N18). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of these sediments, actually outcropping at 150 m above sea level, indicate a deposition in the upper bathyal zone ranging from 200 to 600 m water depth. Our conclusions confirm and precise the exhumation processes during the 19 to 16 Ma interval, and uplift of the Internal Zones since 5 Ma. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Nearly 25% of the pluton consists of mafic rocks that mingled and mixed synplutonically with granitic recks. The mafic recks increased, thereby, the overall density of the pluton, added heat to fuel the upward ascent of the pluton, and helped to heat the wall rocks locally and sufficiently for them to deform viscoelastically above and around the pluton. Gneiss and a thin, concentric and conformable sequence of supracrustal quartzite and amphibolite dip steeply inward around all but the northeast quarter of the pluton, which is faulted. These wall rocks define a concentric rim anticline having a steep limb adjacent to the pluton, and a hat limb farther than 2 km radially from it. Previous interpretations of a rim syncline around the pluton cannot be substantiated. Sparse vertical mineral lineations, vertical necklines of boudins, pluton-up sense of shear in shear folds and associated steep faults, and appressed folds in the supracrustal rocks, all within 100 m of the contact, are relict, mesoscopic evidence of upward and outward expansion of the pluton during its emplacement. The macroscopic downward bending of the wall rocks and consequent formation of the rim anticline may be explained either by ductile return flow of heated wall rocks, or by late-stage magma sinking, or a combination of both processes.

There are four major controls on the occurrence of these landslides: structure, climate, topography and erosion. The tectonic control is through the structure and lithology of phyllites and mica-schists with strong lineations providing preferred seepage and failure planes. Climate controls the long-term, seasonal and short-term water-pressure heads. Topography controls the localised head-pressure gradients as a result of seepage and erosion controls the incidence of slope undercutting by fluvial action. The effects of these controls are tested using a hydrological budget model for percolation to ground water, a finite-element model for ground water flows and stability analysis for modelling the actual failures. The results suggest that in this mountainous terrain while climate may be very important for shallow failures, the erosional history and the consequent morphology are in general much more important except for the trimming induced by occasional very large run-off events.

Thirtynine percent of the ant nests were abandoned before the end of the active season, 16% overwintered once without a change of rock, and 45% overwintered at least two years under the same rock, Rocks protect against extreme temperatures as well as serve as a supplementary source of heat, maintaining optimal conditions for brood development, Rocks thinner than 3.5cm harbored broods for shorter daily periods than did rocks thicker than 3.5cm. The statistical analysis of the mean rock dimensions according to the time of permanence of the nests, showed differences for thickness, surface and volume, The sizes with longer permanence were those with between 2.5 and 4.5cm of thickness and a surface area between 100 and 250cm(2). This kind of rock also proved conducive to the production of sexuals, Thus, for the fitness of the colony, there are suitable and unsuitable rocks. The occupation of the optimal rocks resulted from random discovery by ants, without the availability of favorable nest-sites (rocks) being a limiting factor. When relocation was needed because the rock proved unsuitable, workers relocated the nest under another rock without recognizing or learning to recognize suitable or unsuitable properties, Therefore, there is no prior selection of the rock, The thermal properties of this rock leads to abandonment (if ""bad"") or selection (if ""good""). Thus this process constitutes ""a posterion"" rock selection."	PT: J	 		 	 	 	 				 	0361-6525	 	"Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.

To evaluate the role of plant-plant interactions in shaping these communities we quantified species co-occurrence and interaction in seven environmentally distinct communities. These included four different semiarid habitats in southeast Spain, one alpine system in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain), and two sites in Venezuela, a secondary savanna near Caracas (Altos de Pipe), and a sclerophyllous shrubland in the Gran Sabana plateau. We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects.

Tourmaline appears in a variety of forms: (1) stratiform tourmalinites; (2) quartz-tourmaline nodules; (3) porphyroclasts in felsic orthogneisses; and (4) disseminations in psammopelitic meta-sediments and gneisses. Tourmaline within these lithologic groups exhibits textural and chemical variations that reflect complex premetamorphic growth under open-system conditions, and subsequent changes due to Alpine regional metamorphism. Microprobe analyses of the tourmalines reveal a wide compositional variation between schorl and dravite end members with variable contents of X-site vacancies (av. 0.084-0.225 apfu), Ca (av. 0.095-0.269 apfu), and excess of Al (up to 6.588 apfu) compared with the theoretical value of 6 in ideal schorl and dravite. The amount of Ca may be significant in porphyroclasts from the gneisses. Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios for tourmalines in tourmalinites, metasediments, and gneisses range from 0.34 to 0.95, 0.16 to 0.92, and 0.28 to 0.97, respectively. Na/(Na + Ca) ratios are also variable, mostly ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. Many of the tourmalines have complex chemical and colour zoning patterns, including significant fluctuations in Al, Fe, Mg, Na, Ca, Ti, and F. Based on petrographic and chemical data, three generations of tourmaline have been established. The first generation corresponds to magmatic-postmagmatic tourmaline that is represented by tourmaline porphyroclasts within the orthogneisses. The second generation of tourmaline formed during tourmalinization of psammopelitic rocks giving rise to tourmalinites. The third generation of tourmaline is represented by cellular textures, pale reaction rims and overgrowths developed during the Alpine regional metamorphic overprint. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Electron microprobe analyses of tourmaline and coexisting minerals document both chemical differences dependent on the host-rock type and an irregular distribution of Cr at grain scale. Tourmaline is Na-rich dravite, with average Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios of 0.83 and 0.63 a.p.f.u. and Cr contents of 0.32 and 0.18 a.p.f.u., in dolomitic and ankeritic marbles, respectively. Tourmaline contains small but significant concentrations of Zn (av. 0.01 a.p.f.u.) and in ankeritic marble it also contains Ni (av. 0.04 a.p.f.u.). Zn-rich chromian spinet appears as small relict inclusions in silicates, with average Cr, Fe, Al and Zn contents of 1.201, 1.241, 0.411 and 0.107 a.p.f.u., respectively. Amphibole, epidote, mica and chlorite show average Cr contents of 0.088, 0.138, 0.115 and 0.267 a.p.f.u., respectively, in dolomitic marbles, and 0.103, 0.078, 0.065 and 0.185 a.p.f.u., respectively, in ankeritic marbles. Cr-silicates formed through metamorphic reactions involving detrital Cr-rich spinet, in addition to clay minerals and carbonates. The B necessary to form tourmaline was probably derived from the leaching of underlying evaporitic rocks.

The quantity of the biofilm, covering the bed stones sometimes reached 1 kg wet mass m(-2). It, ETS-activity exceeded by 2.5-5 times, that of the phytoplankton and, by 8.33-22 times, that of the zooplankton, projecting 1 m(2) surface area of the lake. The substrate kinetics of its. ETS suggested eucaryotic property. The plankton concentrated in the deeper water in day time and elevated to the upper water layers by evenings. The daily respiratory carbon loss of the zooplankton, estimated from the ETS-activity was equivalent with 34-38% of the planktonic primary production. The results indicated that the metabolically most active zone was forced to the profound, probably by the intensive UV-b radiation.

At local scales, topography is the most important factor in determining the distribution of solar radiation at the surface. Interpolation techniques are usually employed to estimate solar radiation where stations are not available, but their usefulness is limited where topography is an important source of variability. The use of satellite data and more recently of models based on techniques GIS, have contributed to solve this difficulty. In this work the usefulness of a digital elevation model (DEM) in providing topographic information for the estimation of solar radiation in areas of complex topography is analysed. Daily global radiation values were generated using the Solar Analyst software, which uses topographic information to generate radiation data. The generated data were compared with the experimental data obtained from 14 radiometric stations located within the Sierra Nevada Natural Park (southern Spain), an area of complex topography. Results show the usefulness of the topographic information derived from a DEM to estimate the solar radiation in areas Of complex topography. Nevertheless, results depend on the DEM resolution and it is important that other factors, such as the albedo, should also be taken into account to obtain better estimates.

The results show that in stable atmospheric conditions, the column-integrated aerosol takes an optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm of 0.02 +/- 0.02, and an average radius in the accumulation mode of 0.15 mum, with a likely Atlantic origin. In unstable situations, the AOD at 500 nm can increase by more than an order of magnitude, and the aerosols' origin is uncertain, since air masses can arrive from different sources at different altitudes.

Over a 3 yr period, we monitored changes in the hydrological, chemical and biological regimes of a high mountain lake severely affected by a drought that peaked in 1995. During the drought, the decrease in lake volume enhanced the contribution of the sediment to the lake nutrient budget. The community became more complex, with the appearance of ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, organisms rarely found prior to the drought. The impaired post-drought recovery of the zooplankton, which did not reach normal densities for this lake until 1997, resulted in a microbial-dominated food web in 1996 and a classical grazing food web in 1997. Besides the species composition or abundance and the autotrophic to heterotrophic ratio, food web changes associated with the drought and atmospheric nutrient inputs were reflected in the stoichiometry and contribution of both bacteria and phytoplankton fractions to the planktonic particulate matter. Specific productivity measurements showed that cellular N:P ratios could be used to evaluate the growth conditions of phytoplankton but not of bacteria, indicating that an element other than P may limit bacteria growth. Assessments of phytoplankton and bacteria productivity and of the photosynthetic carbon release relative to bacteria demand in microcosms revealed that after a phosphorus pulse, the phytoplankton N:P ratio determines the nature of the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria as either commensalistic or competitive for inorganic P. If phytoplankton N:P is initially high (P-deficient algae), a P pulse can reduce photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) and bacteria can experience C limitation, whereas if phytoplankton N:P is initially low (P-sufficient algae) and bacteria N:P is high, increased PER is observed and competition for inorganic P may occur.

The inter- and intra-annual changes in the biomass, elemental (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and taxonomical composition of the phytoplankton in a high mountain lake in Spain were studied during 3 years with different physical (fluctuating hydrological regime) and chemical conditions. The importance of internal and external sources of P to the phytoplankton was estimated as the amount of P supplied via zooplankton recycling (internal) or through ice-melting and atmospheric deposition (external). 2. Inter-annual differences in phytoplankton biomass were associated with temperature and total dissolved phosphorus. In 1995, phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with total dissolved phosphorus. In contrast, the negative relationship between zooplankton and seston biomass (direct predatory effects) and the positive relationship between zooplankton P excretion and phytoplankton biomass in 1997 (indirect P-recycling effects), reinforces the primary role of zooplankton in regulating the total biomass of phytoplankton but, at the same time, encouraging its growth via P-recycling. 3. Year-to-year variations in seston C : P and N : P ratios exceeded intra-annual variations. The C : P and N : P ratios were high in 1995, indicating strong P limitation. In contrast, in 1996 and 1997, these ratios were low during ice-out (C : P  1000%), zooplankton recycling (9-542%), and ice-melting processes (0.37-5.16%) satisfied the minimum demand for P of phytoplankton during 1996 and 1997. Although the effect of external forces was rather sporadic and unpredictable in comparison with biologically driven recycle processes, both may affect phytoplankton structure and elemental composition.

Depending (amongst others) on the relative importance of these two factors, the margins of terrestrial sedimentary basins (where alluvial fans develop) produce aggradational, progradational or retrogradational stratigraphic architecture. We studied a total of 43 Quaternary alluvial fans in the Granada and Bajo Segura basins (Betic Cordillera, Spain). The analysis of their stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary facies has revealed the existence of three groups characterised by distinct stratal stacking patterns, which is the result of differences in eustasy and tectonics. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these alluvial fans and their drainage basins has allowed us to define certain characteristic geomorpbological patterns related, in each case, to the main mechanism operative in the creation of accommodation space. These patterns are described as follows. (1) Alluvial aggradation is the main result of high tectonic subsidence with the development of quite open, but small fans with a constant steep slope lacking incised channels and headward-eroding gullies. (2) In contrast, when the principal mechanism in creating accommodation space is low tectonic subsidence, progradation occurs and the fans are narrower and larger. Moreover, the slopes of such fans are less steep in relation to the drainage area than in the above case, being constant or even concave in longitudinal profile. They also have short, deep incised channels, culminating downfan in a depositional lobe. In inactive zones, long, deep headward-eroding gullies develop. (3) Areas of extremely low tectonic subsidence and base level rise produce very open fans in the sedimentary basin, although with a pronounced mountain embayment, which gives them a characteristic ""mushroom"" shape in plan view. In the latter case, retrogradation is the typical stratigraphic stacking pattern and the fans are quite extensive with respect to their drainage areas, usually showing a segmented longitudinal profile with a low gradient. The feeder channels do not surpass stream order 3, and various extremely long and shallow incised channels can appear. (4) Contrary to the case of fans developing under a regime of subsidence, when the accommodation is due to base level rise, the fan slopes bear no relation to the extent of the catchment basins. In such a case, the overall fan slope is strongly influenced by the extent of the mountain embayment because it determines the distributions of debris and sheet-flows over the alluvial surface.

Distribution maps based on all available data for four, in this area rare and poorly known, species: Vertigo substriata, V. modesta arctica, V. lilljeborgi and V. alpestris are presented. The distribution and ecology of the species in the area are discussed. Two species are restricted to higher altitudes in the Pyrenees: V. modesta arctica (3 localities) and V. lilljeborgi (2 localities - first record for Spain). V. substriata and V. alpestris both have a wider distribution, but are very rare and their occurrences scattered. V. alpestris is restricted to the northern and eastern parts of France, V. substriata occurs also in the Pyrenees and northern Spain and has ail isolated occurrence in the south (Sierra Nevada). The total distribution of both species is discussed and North and Middle European is considered a good characterisation of both. Vertigo Baudoni Massot, 1872 is a synonym of V. substriata. Vertigo acheila Servain, 1880 is a synonym of V. pygmaea and not of V. alpestris or V. moulinsiana as previously supposed.

Broth. in Europe was studied by ISSR molecular markers. A few samples of a putative P. andalusica (Hohn.) Broth., growing mixed with P. bolanderi in one of the studied patches, were included in the analysis. The results show that P. andalusica is clearly distinct from P. bolanderi. The inter-species values for pairwise genetic distance obtained by using the Jaccard index are in the range 0.72-0.79. The intraspecies values found using the same index are between 0.03 and 0.38 in the case of P. andalusica and between 0.00 (genetically identical) and 0.47 in the case of P. bolanderi. This range points to the high genetic diversity of P. bolanderi, which is considered as a rare species. According to IUCN criteria, the available data suggest that P. bolanderi, which is mainly threatened by air pollution and tourist development, should be accepted as a vulnerable species in Europe.

In western Sierra Nevada, the detachment has been folded and reactivated since the Upper Miocene. A high-angle normal fault system with NW-SE strikes and a general domino structure is developed in the Alpujarride, but does not cut the detachment. The sediment geometry of the associated asymmetrical basins contributes towards the reconstruction of the fault system.

Spain) were studied. Habitat composition and structure were determined by measuring 15 variables in 0.1 ha circular plots within the territories of breeding pairs. The passerines that nest in the high-mountain areas of the Sierra Nevada show different preferences in their choice of habitat. This interspecific segregation appears both with respect to the vertical complexity of the shrub layer (factor I), and to the patchy distribution of habitat components (factor II). Cluster analysis identified two groups of species: those preferring scrubland (Sylvia communis, Emberiza hortulana and Troglodytes troglodytes), and those favouring open ground (mainly Alauda arvensis, Anthus campestris and Oenanthe oenanthe). Emberiza cia shared characteristics common to both groups, while Phoenicurus ochruros bred in rocky terrain. Discriminant function analysis showed the importance of habitat composition (both shrubs and rocks) and structural variables in species segregation. According to these results, I recommend that studies about avian habitat use include quantitative estimates of rocky substrates, especially in high-mountain areas, tundras and deserts.

Observational and Experimental-Study of a Carnivorous Plant - Ant Kleptobiotic Interaction	Oikos	Oikos	1990	DEC	59	3	368	372	"DROSERA-ROTUNDIFOLIA;PINGUICULA;INTERMEDIA;Environmental Sciences & Ecology ER"	I analyzed the characteristics of prey robbed by ants (Formica fusca group) from an endemic carnivorous plant (Pinguicula nevadense) of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). The kleptobiotic interaction could be tested by detailed observations of ants when they searched for food near the plants. I observed a total of 60 ants stealing prey. Ants selectively steal the larger prey, which numerically represents a small fraction of the total prey. Ants also prefer to rob recently captured prey which do not show any signs of damage by the digestion of the plant. To quantify experimentally the rate of prey robbery, I put individuals of Drosophila melanogaster on labelled leaves. Forty seven % of the flies initially placed were robbed in the first 24 h in the site where ants occur. Extraction success depends on the position of the flies on the leaf. The curling movement of the leaves makes the detection and extraction of prey by the ants difficult. The quick extraction of the bigger prey could represent a strong limitation for the plant, as this kleptoparasitic interaction appears during the whole short growth and flowering period of this carnivorous plant.

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure.

More than 98% of the damage to terminal shoots was caused by goats and Spanish ibex in Sierra Nevada and sheep in Sierra de Baza. Some 72% of the tagged saplings (n = 619) were browsed during at least 1 year of monitoring (1995-1997). There were between-forest differences in herbivory pressure. Moreover, the herbivory pressure was significantly higher during a dry year (1995) than during wet ones (1996 and 1997). Overall, when browsing a sapling, ungulates consumed almost 30% of its apical shoots, and 85% of saplings were browsed more than once after establishment. As a consequence, ungulates severely affected the Scots pine sapling growth rate, and therefore browsed saplings grew slower than saplings unbrowsed by ungulates. Thus, according to exponential growth equations, the time necessary to attain a height threshold to escape from mammalian herbivores (150 cm height in our study forests) and start reproduction was retarded by the herbivory up to 12 years. Ungulates are a major factor hindering the natural regeneration and conservation of the last relict forests of Scots pines in SE Spain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

As a consequence of sewage discharges from a ski resort situated at the head of the stream and from populations along its banks, the river is affected by organic pollution. With the objective of finding what physico-chemical factors determined the distribution of the Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera along the course of the stream, and in what manner they were affected, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis was applied. Through this analysis it was possible to prove that, in general, the distribution and abundance of these two orders of insects in the Rio Monachil are influenced by organic pollution. Nevertheless, at the species level other factors assume prime importance, such as temperature, oxygenation and mineralization of the waters, parameters which may or may not be related to pollution.
