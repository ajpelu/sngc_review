The 1st, corresponding to the nominate subspecies, occupies the north, the center and the east of the Iberian Peninsula [Spain, Portugal], and extends southwards as far as the Sierra Nevada [Spain]. The 2nd subspecies V. l. gaditana is characterized by a smaller number of ventral scales (130.88 .+-. 4.41 instead of 141.31 .+-. 3.46) and is widely distributed in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, the Rif, the Middle Atlas [northern Africa] and the Algerian Tell.

In a collection of 227 plants from all parts of the distribution area of the species, the chromosome numbers 2n = 34, 51, 68, 102 and 136 were found. In S. album the morphological variation is not correlated with the differences in chromosome numbers. On the contrary, a more or less continuous morphological series occurs in this species within which a number of geographical races can be distinguished. The very small plants from Gotland (Sweden) are an extreme of this series. In the Baltic region plants with pale green leaves and yellow anthers occur which differ from the typical form in that they do not synthesize cyanidin. They have been described as var. pallens Hartm. and are classified here as forma pallens. Of all European Sedum species S. gypsicolum Boiss. et Reuter is the one which resembles S. album most closely and it also has the basic chromosome number X = 17. In 6 plants from the sierra Nevada (Spain) the chromosome numbers 2n = 68 and 102 were found. Since S. album and S. gypsicolum differ in a number of morphological characters and since a polyploid series occurs within both taxa they should be regarded as distinct species."

A majority of these were diploid (2n = 24), but a few triploids (3n = 36) were present in the population from the highest altitude. All the diploid plants from three of these populations were basic homozygotes with homomorphic bivalents. In one population, however, three types of plants were identified: homozygous standard plants (80%), plants heterozygous for a large supernumerary chromosome segment (19%), and plants homozygous for its same segment (1%). The segment was located terminally on the short arm of a submetacentric chromosome. It was heteropycnotic at meiotic prophase, showed dark C-banding at metaphase I, and was visible as a prominent heterochromatic chromocentre at interphase. The segment divided reductionally in a majority of anaphase I cells (88%), which means that chiasmata tend to be excluded from the arm carrying the segment. Seeds obtained from plants homozygous for the extra segment always carried one such segment. One-half of the seedlings of heterozygous plants are themselves heterozygous for the extra segment, while the other half lack the segment. Finally, 11% of the seeds from bulbs without a segment turned out to be segment heterozygotes. From these results, it is deduced that the extra segment is sexually transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and that it has little or no effect on male fertility and fecundity."

The morphology and development of these soils are due to the action of the climate of high mountain with big stational contrast, a vegetation which is typical of the edges of river with some nitrate accumulator species and the parent material, micaschist. The accumulation and the degree of humifidication of organic matter is related with the contribution of high amounts of roots and other plant residues as were on the action and quantities of worms. The hydromorphy of these soils is reduced to the presence of red mottled of iron near of the stones and gravel. The soil type gley evolve in a reductor regimen of moisture which is not present in our soils because of the water in the voids of these soils is not a stagnant water but a water which circulates and whose contribution is linked to the thaw of the snow of Sierra Nevada and so is a water that contains O2.

Three types of plants were identified: (i) diploid plants (2n = 18, 26%); (ii) diploid plants with a variable number of B chromosomes (1-8 B's, 40%); and (iii) polysomic plants (2n = 19-23) with or without B's (34%). B's are of two types: metacentric and acrocentric and are associated with three types of abnormalities: (i) failure of the A chromosomes to move to the poles at anaphase I; (ii) nondisjunction of some A chromosomes at anaphase II; and (iii) the occurrence of tetraploid sporocytes. The B's are isopycnotic, do not associate with the A's, and invariably occur as univalents at first meiosis but show no tendency for elimination. All members of the complement except the satellite chromosome, no. 6, have been detected in a trisomic or a tetrasomic condition. Additionally some unusual structural variants, not present in the diploid standard complement, appear in some polysomic individuals. The polysomic elements are euchromatic, stable, and they do not associate either with normal chromosomes or with B's. The polysomic elements form univalents when they are trisomic and bivalents when tetrasomic. The fact that a high frequency (94%) of the polysomic elements also carry B's suggests that these two forms of numerical variation are interrelated in origin."

Respect to altitude, preferences of different species are shown which allow as differentiate groups of low, medium and high mountain, however some species lives in a wide range of altitudes. Their distribution during the year is very different: few species are present during all the year. Each season, or even each short seasonal period has its own faune. Typically explosive species appear between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. They are progressively present at different altitudes in all excrements and generally with high number of specimens. The greatest abundance at the different hours of the day is in relation with the activity of different species."

The earlier reported (ALONSO, 1975) occurrence of hibernicum, obtusale, pseudosphaerium and tenuilineatum is obviously due to incorrect identifications. Until evidence is available, these four species have to be struck off from the faunal list of Granada. The snails belong to 20 taxa. At most 10 species of molluscs have been found living in association. In waters of about 3,000 m above sea level only P. casertanum occurs.

Of the 149 taxa collected, 21 are Cyanophyceae, 2 are Dinophyceae, 8 are Euglenophyceae, 5 are Chrysophyceae, 51 are Diatomophyceae, 28 are Chlorophyceae and 34 are Zygophyceae. Eleven taxa were new records for the Spanish phycoflora. Eunotia pseudopectinalis, E. sudetica, Netrium oblongum var. curvatum and Actinotaenium adelochondrum var. kriegeri, all with an arctic-alpine distribution, were singled out for their biogeographical interest. Nostoc kihlmani, Meridion circulare, Cymbella minuta, Pediastrum boryanum, Cosmarium garrolense and Staurastrum hirsutum were the taxa with the widest distribution among the lagoons studied. Finally, a new combination was proposed: Eunotia pseudopectinalis var. vasconiensis [E. flexuosa var. vasconiensis]."

In the second part, he describes the main lithological unities of the province (N-E sector calcareous and mountainous; S-E with the Sierra Nevada siliceous; West with great complexity). The great part of the work is an analysis of the climate. The average temperature shows a N-E sector with great amplitudes, comparatively cool; a S-E region with steep thermical gradients of altitude and a hot west region, with slight amplitude. The maximas of rainfall are in the western region and the N-E. After the study of regional climates, the author analyses the coastal one, and he tries to build an accurate system for the definition of the mediterranean mountain climates."

The kleptobiotic interaction could be tested by detailed observations of ants when they searched for food near the plants. I observed a total of 60 ants stealing prey. Ants selectively steal the larger prey, which numerically represents a small fraction of the total prey. Ants also prefer to rob recently captured prey which do not show any signs of damage by the digestion of the plant. To quantify experimentally the rate of prey robbery, I put individuals of Drosophila melanogaster on labelled leaves. Forty seven % of the flies initially placed were robbed in the first 24 h in the site where ants occur. Extraction success depends on the position of the flies on the leaf. The curling movement of the leaves makes the detection and extraction of prey by the ants difficult. The quick extraction of the bigger prey could represent a strong limitation for the plant, as this kleptoparasitic interaction appears during the whole short growth and flowering period of this carnivorous plant."

Data from a 24 hour sampling program have revealed zooplankton to show, as a whole, a definite nocturnal migration, comparable to that previously described (CRUZ-PIZARRO, 1978, 1981; CARRILLO et al., 1989). Within the phytoplankton, non-motile and close to neutrally buoyant species (mainly Cyanarcus sp.) showed a limited daily vertical movement remaining, for most of the cycle, at the upper/intermediate layers. These species were used as a reference against which to evaluate the vertical distribution of flagellates which, despite minor specific differences, exhibited a common pattern of migration (exemplified by that of Chromulina nevadensis) involving an evening upward movement and a return downward one after dawn, both roughly coinciding with the highest values of the relative rate of change in light. Zooplankton grazing might account for much of the observed day-night differences in biomass (and density) of motile algal species. Recruitments from narrow but unsampled water layers (such as the neuston) might also contribute to explain the unrealistic computed net growth rates for C. nevadensis in the early morning. Light is probably the stimulus for the algal movement. The possibility of exploiting rich nutrient micropatchiness generated by zooplankton excretion should be able to explain its adaptive value, as other major proposed hypotheses can be discounted in this particular environment."

A rapid cooling stage can be identified from the high nucleation density and high n-values of minerals. A final stage of slow cooling, is identified by a low nucleation density and low n-values. At this stage a residual melt crystallized in thermal equilibrium to the cooling rate of the whole magma chamber. Thermal equilibrium and convection are necessary conditions for mixing. Enclaves can be interpreted as the remaining, non-disaggregated portions of an early injected mafic magma, which in turn underwent hybridization during injection. Their presence indicates the existence of magma mixing proceses and the possibility that the host granitoid was a hybrid rock."

This metamorphic nappe is of great interest to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Betic Chain since two episodes of thrusting inside the same Alpujarride Nappe can be differentiated. These two episodes have been produced in different physical (P. T) conditions and with different directions of thrusting: the first one towards the northeast and the second towards the north-northwest. Furthermore, the plate tectonics reconstructions (Weijermars, 1987; Dewey, 1988) and geodynamic models (Andrieux et al., 1989; Platt and Vissers, 1989) published so far for the Betic Chain have not considered these two episodes of thrusting recognized in all nappes belonging to the Alpujarride Complex of the Betic Chain. In the area studied, to the south of Sierra Nevada, the Adra Nappe shows a marked structural variation, from an upper folded zone consisting of low-grade metamorphic rocks, to a mylonitic zone located in lower levels and characterized by medium to high-grade metamorphic materials. It has been observed that the emplacement of the Adra Nappe has involved two episodes. The first episode produces the formation of mylonitic rocks with a stretching lincation N45-degrees-E. The second one gives rise to gouges and fault breccias, and is bound to movements of the upper block in N10-degrees-W direction. From a regional point of view, in this sector the Adra Nappe occupies the upper tectonic position of the Alpujarride Complex. The extensional regime of the Adra Nappe appears to be intimately associated with the N-S convergence of Africa and Iberia from Oligocene times, whereas the NE-thrusting would reflect a previous strike-slip motion parallel to the trend of the Betic Chain, probably in an oblique convergence setting. These points concerning the two directions of movement must be considered for geological palacoreconstructions of the Western Mediterranean area."

A higher reproductive index, increased juvenil survival, less variable fluctuations in numbers were observed in the eastern Sierra Nevada. This can be correlated with the lower density (2 in km2) compared with the 11 km2 in the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura. This follows the predictions of large-mammal population models, which postulates that density-dependent food limitation occurs at densities near the ecological carrying capacity. In spite of the high adult male mortality usual in most ungulate populations, the sex ratio remained in balance most years in the areas studied. This was probably due to the lower rate of survival found among female young. A significant correlation was found in both the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura and the Sierra Nevada populations between the annual precipitation and kid production and survival of the young (from 6-18 mths), the correlation being closer where population densities were higher (Sierra de Cazorla y Segura population). The negative correlation observed between the spring/summer precipitation and the kid to female ratio during the rut period is probably due to perinatal mortality caused by the weather."

The passerines that nest in the high-mountain areas of the Sierra Nevada show different preferences in their choice of habitat. This interspecific segregation appears both with respect to the vertical complexity of the shrub layer (factor I), and to the patchy distribution of habitat components (factor II). Cluster analysis identified two groups of species: those preferring scrubland (Sylvia communis, Emberiza hortulana and Troglodytes troglodytes), and those favouring open ground (mainly Alauda arvensis, Anthus campestris and Oenanthe oenanthe). Emberiza cia shared characteristics common to both groups, while Phoenicurus ochruros bred in rocky terrain. Discriminant function analysis showed the importance of habitat composition (both shrubs and rocks) and structural variables in species segregation.

We have quantified the abundance and foraging behavior of P. longiseta in comparison with winged flower visitors. We have also examined, by means of selective exclusion experiments, the role of ants as true pollinators, comparing them with the winged flower visitors. A total of 39 species belonging to 18 families visited the flowers of H. spinosa. All the visitors were winged insects, except P. longiseta, a species which alone made up more than 80% of the total number of insects found on the flowers. All pollinators of H. spinosa had similar foraging patterns, with 98% of total movements made between flowers within the same plant. Ants always made contact with the plant reproductive organs when foraging for nectar, and transferred large numbers of pollen grains. However, pollen exposed to ants for brief periods exhibited reduced percentage of germination. P. longiseta is both the most abundant and spatio-temporally predictable flower visitor of H. spinosa. These characteristics, weighted by their flower visitation rate, make worker ants the pollinator that maintains the strongest mutualistic interaction with H. spinosa. The exclusion experiments show that workers behave as true pollinators, since they contribute to increase the number of viable seeds produced by H. spinosa. The key factor of this interaction is mainly the great density of workers throughout the flowering period. In short, the H. spinosa-P. longiseta mutualistic interaction mainly depends on its high probability of occurrence."

Canigou (A. pyrenaea) as on type specimens available (A. spinosa). Their male have been identified from museum specimens (MHNP), matching based on circumstantial evidence.

The general pattern of altitudinal zonation shows an increase in species richness from the headwaters ( 1000 m : 113 spp.) was not obtained.

Eighty plants belonging to three populations were permanently labelled during the period 1988-91, and in each plant the duration and date of flowering as well as the estimated flowering synchrony, were noted. The composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage, the abundance of the floral herbivores and the effect of the seed and fruit consumers were also recorded. 2 In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the relationship between the flowering synchrony and the three rate-based components of reproductive success (fruit set, brood size and female fertility) were studied. The effect of phenotypic selection on flowering synchrony, as well as on duration and time of flowering, was also studied for these three years, using the method of multiple regression for correlated characters. 3 The flowering synchrony of H. spinosa plants ranged from 0.25 to 1.00, although more than 70% of the marked plants had a flowering synchrony level greater than 0.75. The plants with a lower degree of flowering synchrony were visited by a greater number of pollinators and eaten by fewer herbivores. 4 However, only in 1989 and 1990 was there a significant relationship between flowering synchrony and brood size of the plants. In addition, the phenological traits did not affect female fertility. The results show that neither directional nor stabilizing/disruptive selection acts on flowering synchrony. For these reasons, I suggest that the flowering synchrony of H. spinosa is not regulated by selective pressure of pollinators or herbivores."

This behaviour led us to investigate whether a particular type of rock is selected, and, if so, the advantages to this species of the selection. This study was located at 2400 m above sea-level in the Sierra Nevada mountains (Granada, Spain). To determine the range of rock sizes available, in eight control plots the thicknesses were recorded and also the maximum and minimum diameters of all rocks with surface area of more than 6 cm2. A total of 1724 rocks were recorded, noting among the rock types available those that were used for nesting. Also as a preliminary estimate of the thermal characteristics of the rocks, we recorded the temperatures of the air, soil surface, soil under a rock covering an ant nest, and soil at 30 cm depth. The results indicate that P. longiseta selects flat rocks with a surface area/thickness ratio of 2-5, the thickness being not less than 1.5 cm, the surface area being 50-250 cm2 and volume less than 1000 cm3. This type of rock offers the nests two beneficial but apparently contradictory effects: (1) protection against high temperatures on hot days, and (2) warmth on colder days by absorbing the diffusing solar heat more effectively than the air or soil around the nest."

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure."

The magma was anatectically generated, intruded almost free of restite, and evolved as a closed system by crystallization in situ. Geochemical modelling indicates that the lower and middle zones followed an equilibrium crystallization path, with no separation between solids and melt, and the upper zone followed a fractional crystallization path. Magmatic fractionation produced leucocratic differentiates with high P concentrations and a P/Ca ratio higher than in apatite. The excess P is located in plagioclase and K-feldspar. Monazite (+apatite) fractionation in the lower and middle zones produced extreme depletions in Th, U, Y, and the REEs, and chondrite-normalized REE patterns with low LREEs/HREEs and a slight discontinuity between Nd and Sm. About 90% of the Th, U, Y, and REEs reside in accessory minerals, especially in monazite. Biotite and muscovite have very low REE contents with small positive or no Eu anomalies. K-feldspar and plagioclase in both the lower and upper zones have moderate REE contents with positive Eu anomalies. Feldspars from the upper zone, in contrast, have negative Eu anomalies and have very low REE contents. Compared to available data from literature, D(Sr,Ba,Th,U,Y,REFs)bio/mineral are lower by one to three orders of magnitude, and D(REEs)plag/Kfsp are also lower by one order of magnitude. These huge discrepancies are attributed not only to contamination with REE-rich inclusions in mineral concentrates sed in previous studies, but to real differences in geochemical behavior of trace elements in peraluminous systems, with respect to subaluminous systems. Biotite/melt and, probably, K-feldspar/melt distribution coefficients for Th, U, Y, and the REEs in peraluminous magmas must be much lower than previously considered."

A ratio of autotrophs to heterotrophs lower than 1 which lasted more than two thirds of the study period may suggest a high algal productivity per unit of biomass. The estimated strong top-down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton indicates an efficient utilization of resources. A comparative analysis between the available food supply and the critical food concentration that is necessary to maintain the population of Daphnia pulicaria (which constitutes up to 98 % of the heterotrophic biomass) proves this species to be food-limited in the lake under study. To explain the dominance (and development) of such large-bodied cladoceran population, we discuss the possibility of the utilization of naked protozoan ciliates (Oligotrichidae) as a complementary high quality food source, and the exploitation of benthic resources through a coupled daily migration behaviour."

In the uplands of the Alpujarra, the traditional landscape most at risk is that of the irrigated cultivation terraces. These have often been established centuries ago and rely on water abstracted from streams draining the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The causes of this deintensification include labour shortages, which many Alpujarra municipios reporting population decreases of up to 50 per cent since 1950. Landsat Thematic Mapper digital data from May and August 1992 have been used to identify the various land cover components of the Alpujarra. Ground verification undertaken in September 1992 and April 1993 has confirmed that deintensification of terraced areas around the villages of Trevelez (at 1500 m, the highest village in Spain) and Portugos (1300 m) can be identified as either grassland or matorral. It is recognized that many classes of land cover are mosaics with several elements at a subpixel scale (e.g. terrace risers with fruit trees). However, the output from image processing has allowed areal estimates of the main land covers representing deintensification within the terraced zone. The pattern of deintensification of terraced land is fairly complex. It can be assumed that all terraces were irrigated and cropped at some stage. Land which is no longer cropped is usually grazed and the invasion of matorral species is common, particularly when irrigation ceases. Unirrigated tree crops and vines are sometimes planted on terraces no longer used for cropping. A model of deintensification of farming on terraced land in the Alpujarra is presented."

A population in the Cazorla and Segura mountains is rapidly declining, but the eastern Sierra Nevada population is growing. The stable population density obtained using estimated values of kid and adult survival (0.49 and 0.87, respectively) and with fecundity equal to 0.367 in the absence of density feedback is 12.7 or 16.82 individuals/km(2), based on a non-time-lagged and a time-lagged model, respectively. Given the maximum estimate of fecundity and an adult survival rate of 0.87, a kid survival rate of at least 0.41 is required to avoid extinction. At the minimum fecundity estimate, kid survival would have to exceed 0.52. Elasticities were used to estimate the influence of variation in life-cycle parameters on the intrinsic rate of increase. Adult survival is the most critical parameter, while fecundity and juvenile survival are less important. An increase in adult survival from 0.87 to 0.91 in the Cazorla and Segura mountains population would almost stabilize the population in the absence of stochastic variation, while the same increase in the Sierra Nevada population would yield population growth of 4-5% per annum. A reduction in adult survival to 0.83 results in population decline in both cases."

I studied the spatial pattern of Cuscuta infestation in H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada, Spain, for 6 years (1988-1993). In addition, I assessed the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage of Cuscuta during 1991. I determined the effect of dodder on H. spinosa reproductive success by comparing the fruit and seed production of both parasitized and non-parasitized host plants, and determining the mortality factors affecting reproductive potential. Cuscuta epithymum was found to parasitize the labelled host plants only in three of the six years of study, and only in two of the three host plant populations. The maximum percentage of infestation ocurred in 1990, in which 20% of the labelled host plants were parasitized by dodders in one population and 15% in the other population. No labelled host plant had more than 35% of its canopy surface covered by dodders. Parasitized plants were visited by fewer pollinators than were non-parasitized plants. In addition, the diversity of the pollinator assemblage also differed between these two groups of plants. The dodder did not significatively affect the fruit or seed production of its host plant, either during the study years or the years following the strong infestation. The dodder causes little harm mainly because it is scarce. However, even the relationship between an individual dodder and an individual host plant is neutral, due to the array of direct and indirect, positive and negative effects appearing between Cuscuta and H. spinosa during the sucessives phases of the reproductive cycle of the host plant."

By means of observational and experimental approaches, we focused on the possible regulatory effects of parasitoids on the weevil population as well as on the analysis of the sign and strength of the resulting indirect effects on plant fitness. Weevils attacked 21.7% of the fruit produced by H. spinosa during the study, selecting fruits having the most seeds. Seeds eaten by weevils were significantly bigger than uneaten ones. The number of seeds per fruit after being depredated by Ceutorhynchus was significantly smaller than for fruit not attacked. Thus, weevils affect the fitness of the host plant both by decreasing the number of seeds (quantitative effect) and by reducing the average size of surviving seeds per fruit (qualitative effect). When parasitoids were excluded experimentally, the percentage of attacked fruit (which corresponds to the number of weevil larvae) rose from 20 to 43%. We assume that the increase in the experimental weevil population may be because excluding parasitoids eliminates not only death by parasitoid oviposition for some Ceutorhynchus larvae, but also death by direct predation of parasitoids on weevil larvae. We have also experimentally verified that parasitoid activity benefits the entire plant, by way of parasitoids contributing to a higher average number of seeds dispersed per fruit in each plant, by influencing both the abundance of the weevils and the behavior of the weevil larvae."

Ventral valves of the ovipositor were very short, appearing as two spurs; dorsal valves were longer but still shorter than normal. The specimen had an apparently normal testis on the left side and a well-developed ovary on the right side. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 2n = 28 + X0 chromosomes in the testis and 2n = 28 + XX in the ovary, the same as standard males and females, respectively, of this species. This suggests that the gynandromorphism occurred at a very early developmental stage. This gynandromorph could have originated from the formation of a binucleate egg by second-polar-body reactivation and Subsequent fertilization by two spermatozoa, one male- and the other female-determining; however, the most parsimonious explanation is the elimination of one X chromosome in a female-determined zygote (XX) at the first cleavage division."

The seasonal succession of phytoplankton is characterized by a shift in dominance from eukaryotic species to prokaryotic cyanobacteria, as in a eutrophic lake. This unusual pattern for an oligotrophic lake is related to the release of zooplankton phosphorus, rather than to the amount of total phosphorus. The highest estimated values of this released phosphorus occur during the co-dominance of small-sized species and of one calanoid population, both under natural and experimental conditions. Our experimental results clearly reveal that a blue-green species replaces non-blue-green ones when environmental conditions render low or intermediate values for released phosphorus, irrespective of the grazing pressure. The absence of predators or high levels of released phosphorus stimulate non-blue-green growth. These results agree with the successional pattern observed for the algal assemblage under natural conditions. Nutrient recycling plays an essential role in the maintenance of the metabolism of the pelagic system, and therefore the prevalence of a top-down regulation mechanism as proposed for such low-nutrient environments should be reconsidered."

In the Alboran domain of the central Betics, the present distribution of the Alpujarride units results from the extensional dismembering of a pre-Miocene nappe stack under brittle conditions. The interference of two subperpendicular and successive extensional fault systems can explain the current geometric pattern of the Alpujarride units: upper-Burdigalian-Langhian north-south extension was followed by west- to southwestward extension of Serravallian age. Northeast of Sierra Nevada, these two extensional systems have resulted in a spectacular chocolate tablet megastructure and the cropping out, at any one vertical sequence, of a varying number of extensional units belonging to the Alpujarride complex. This pattern can be considered representative of the middle Miocene tectonics of the entire Alboran domain in the Betics, and illustrates the development of rifting processes in the upper crust."

The size-abundance distribution was dominated by medium-sized phytoplankton cells (Gymnodinium cf. excavatum, Tetraselmis apiculata, Dunaliella spe. and several diatom species), large ciliates (Fabrea salina) and a few zooplankton species adapted to changing temporary environments within a wide size range (Cletocamptus retrogressus, Moina salina, Branchinella spinosa). This polymodal size distribution is compared with results obtained in other systems, including small physically controlled lakes, large lakes, oceans and marine benthos. Consideration of the size structure within homogeneous groups of organisms shows slopes less negative than the average for the whole size range analyzed, a feature which is common in small and physically controlled ecosystems. A seasonal study of the size structure revealed uneven distributions throughout the year, resulting in discontinuities in the size spectra as well as in differences of total size range. There were noticeable differences among the size spectra at each particular time, showing phases of primary producer predominance and phases with a marked predominance of consumers. The time-integrated size spectrum did not exhibit any distinct discontinuity. The influence of extreme shallowness and resuspension on the shape and dynamics of the size spectrum is examined and discussed compared to deeper aquatic systems."

Since the capacity of H. bulgarica to perform vertical migrations in these lakes of Sierra Nevada is already known, we have studied the relationship between egg ratios and chlorophyll-a concentration, mean temperatures and temperature instability (measured as the daily rate of temperature change - TCR - as well as the surface-bottom temperature difference - SBT -) in both lakes.

An in situ experiment was carried out in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake (La Caldera) to quantify the specific release rates of ammonium and phosphorus in different phases of the seasonal succession of plankton. The zooplankton community was dominated by the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. 2. The rates of release of N and P (from non-detectable to 3.58 mu gN mg(-1) DW h(-1) and from 0.26 to 2.29 mu g P mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively) and the N : P released ratio (not detectable to 4.77) fell within the range typical of oligotrophic lakes dominated by copepodite assemblages. 3. The values of the zooplankton N : P ratio (5 : 1 to 10 : 1 by weight) were lower than those established for other species of calanoids, and followed a well-established pattern of seasonal variation from year to year with higher values after ice thaw and lower values as individual size increased (ontogenetic development). 4. The elemental composition of the zooplankton depended on individual size, while the released N : P ratio was inversely related to the N : P ratio of the food. This pattern conforms to the predictions of the homeostasis theory of Sterner (1990). 5. A feedback regulation was established between the stoichiometric composition of the zooplankton, their food and the released N : P ratio that can help explain changes in pelagic community structure during the ice-free period."

Values of the specific gross release rate (SGRR) fluctuated between 0.2 and 2.9 mu g P mg(-1) dry weight h(-1), and were higher when the nauplii of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus dominated the zooplankton community. The rate of P recycling by the zooplankton was high, reaching 1.6 mu g P l(-1) day(-1), and showed a highly consistent seasonal pattern from one year to the next, with maxima in midsummer. Zooplankton size accounted for as much as 85% of the variance obtained in the measurements of the specific rate of P release, while other factors, such as the quality or quantity of food, did not significantly influence the SGRR changes. Among the models tested, only the one proposed by Peters (Int. Ver. Theor. Angew. Limnol. Verh., 19, 273-279, 1975) was useful for predictions in this system. The stoichiometric model of Hessen and Andersen (Arch. Hydrobiol., 35, 111-120, 1992), applied in this oligotrophic system, adequately predicted the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, whereas the values of P release estimated using this model were far higher than the excretion rates obtained experimentally. These differences were related to the type of egestion (formation of faecal pellets) of metazooplankton and to the relative importance of the food resistance to digestion. We believe that in communities where copepods constitute a substantial percentage of the zooplankton, an evaluation of the P release which is readily available [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), total dissolved phosphate (TDP)] to algae and bacteria would not fit the predictions of general models of mass balance; under these circumstances, assimilation efficiency proves to be the key parameter for predicting the readily available P (excreted P)."

Scattered major- and trace-element chemistry together with heterogeneous Sr-Nd isotopic results preclude an origin of this ultramafic-to-granitoid association by any closed-system fractionation process. Ultramafic rocks include peridotites, pyroxenites and hornblendites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.5 to -1.3 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)i ratio from 0.7059 to 0.7080. They are interpreted as cumulates formed by ''in situ'' fractional crystallization from contaminated basaltic magmas, particularly by interaction with Sr-87-enriched fluids. Mafic rocks comprise biotite-amphibole diorites, quartz diorites and tonalites with epsilon Nd-i from -3.8 to 0.0 and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio from 0.7058 to 0.7073. They represent either cumulates or more evolved magmas of calc-alkaline affinity. These rocks display an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the degree of contamination inferred from isotope data. This points to wall-rock assimilation by thermal erosion during ascent of basic magmas up to the middle crust and supports the participation of mantle sources with positive epsilon Nd-i and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) < 0.7058. Granitoids range from amphibole-biotite tonalites, through biotite granodiorites to monzonitic granites. They show an isotopic trend which diverges from that of ultramafic and mafic rocks. epsilon Nd-i (-6.0 to -1.9) decreases while (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratio (0.7061 to 0.7082) increases from tonalites to monzonitic granites, reflecting an increasing contribution of crustal components in more differentiated rocks. Assimilation and fractional crystallization, mixing included, account for such an evolution. Contamination of basic magmas by this process occurring at deeper crustal level produced hybrid tonalites and related matric magmatic enclaves. Only monzonitic granites are interpreted as pure crustal melts. Their HREE fractionated patterns [(Gd/Yb)(N) = 4-5] suggest equilibrium with a garnet-rich residuum. Partial melting of moderate time-integrated Rb/Sr protolith, such as greywackes and/or meta-igneous rocks of intermediate-acid composition, could account for the isotopic composition of these monzogranites. This example shows that at least some calc-alkaline granitoids of collisional settings are not produced by pure intra-crustal melting. They are formed through a complex, multi-stage hybridization process, involving mantle-derived magmas, crustal components and several concomitant magmatic processes."

The pollinator-exclusion experiments show that H. spinosa, under natural conditions, does not produce seed by apomixis or spontaneous autogamy. H. spinosa appears to be self-incompatible but slightly geitonogamous. Thus, this plant species needs pollen vectors for reproduction. The results of the wind-exclusion experiments performed during two different years in two populations of H. spinosa support the hypothesis that the wind acts as a pollen vector; flowers excluded from the wind had a lower fruit set and female fertility than Bowers excluded from all pollinator insects (winged and wingless). This generalist pollination system (insects and wind) permits this species to colonize and sustain viable populations in high mountains, where this species is the only woody shrub living above 3000 m above sea level in the Sierra Nevada."

We determined several plant and ant traits, as well as the composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage. Insects belonging to 29 families and five orders visited the flowers of the plant species studied. In all but two, L. subulatum and G. struthium, the ants comprised 70-100% of the flower visitors. The results clearly show that five out of seven of these plant species were pollinated by ants. The role of the ants as pollinators seems to depend heavily on the relative abundance of the ants with respect to the other species of the pollinator assemblage, ant pollination becoming evident when ants outnumber other floral visitors. The ant-pollination systems analysed in this study may be the result of prevailing ecological conditions more than an evolutionary result of a specialized interaction."

Its principal palaeogeographical characteristics are a large lake in the eastern sector, an axial fluvial system and two fluvial systems transverse to it in the western sector, The uplift of a central sector of the Betic Cordillera during the Upper Pleistocene affected the study area, causing northward tilting from the Internal Zone of the cordillera (Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza), step-faulting of the Plio-Pleistocene infill of the ancient basin (leaving more northern sectors in a lower topographical position), alteration of fluvial current profiles and displacement of the ancient Axial System to a position very close to the divide between the ancient endorheic Guadix Basin and the Guadalquivir Basin. This facilitated capture of the endorheic basin by the headward erosion of a tributary of the Guadalquivir River. The region then began to be rapidly eroded, as the new base level was now some 500m lower than that of the ancient basin. The present drainage network is similar to that of the ancient endorheic basin as regards the location of the main streams and the distribution of drainage patterns and fluvial styles, although flow reversal is found in some stretches and a barbed drainage pattern appears locally. As a result of the inheritance of drainage from the ancient basin, fluvial superimposition is found in some stretches of the main streams. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Three allocycles of tectonic origin were recognised across which there is a clear evolution from debris flow to sheet flow dominated fans, in connection with a decrease in the volume of fines available in the source areas. The larger volume of accommodation space created by higher tectonic subsidence in the northern sector favoured vertical accumulation of sediment, with the appearance of less elongated fans. In the rest of the system, where subsidence is less, more elongated fans appear, with the development of incised channels and irregular distribution of sediment in depositional lobes. This involves the appearance of markedly asymmetric transverse profiles, as well as lengthy recurrence between the sedimentation events on particular sectors of the fans, where headward-eroding gullies develop. The Lithology of the source area, where intensely fractured rocks are found, is responsible for an important sediment supply and a significant degree of clast sorting from the source area. Consequently, a weak longitudinal trend in particle size can be recognised, which influences the predominance of longitudinal constant-slope profiles and anomalous relations between both fan area and fan slope and their drainage areas. Recent intense tectonic activity has caused the appearance of abnormally low slopes in upper sectors of some catchments, where mass flows are trapped, and the fans present a subsequently higher proportion of sheet flows. Recent piracy phenomena can be recognised in some of the drainage basins, which indicate rejuvenation of the source area, in which case the fan presents a rapid increase in the proportion of mass flows with the development of a segmented longitudinal profile. Due to the recent nature of the processes, the morphometric relations in the fan fed by the basin affected by capture do not coincide with the other fans in the area. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

Despite the brevity of the active period (<4 mo), larvae complete their development in 1 season, entering winter as adults; consequently, the colony hibernates without brood. We studied the different phases of ovarian development and their relationship to the annual development of the brood as well as with abiotic conditions. The most striking finding is that after egg laying, the ovarioles recuperate slowly over the hibernation period at temperatures of nearly 1 degrees C, becoming fully developed ovaries capable of oviposition by the onset of the active period. We interpret this response as being an adaptation to a short active period as well as a compensation for the absence of a brood during the winter.

Each fruit bore an average of 5.4 ovules, of which 4.0 ovules died early in their development and 0.1 aborted. Each fruit sets an average of 1.3 mature seeds. Seed predators invariably infested more than 65% of the fruits every year, killing 87% of the seeds ripened by the plants. More than 90% of the seeds predators were weevils. However, including the other two predispersal mortality factors, we found that the main lass was to ovule death (74% of the initial number of ovules), whereas seed predation destroyed 19% of the ovules. The effect of the plant on the seed-predator survival is somewhat different. Although weevils were parasitized by a wasp, the main mortality factor during the larval stage within the fruits was starvation. Of weevil larvae, 68% died before completing the life cycle because eggs were not laid on mature seed and were unable to enter a seed. As the plant capacity for filling seeds was not correlated with herbivory, the mortality of weevil larvae depended mostly on external predispersal events."

An approach which integrates kinematic, foliation, and thermochronologic data is advocated, and an example from southern Spain is used as an illustration. AMT ages from the Sierra Nevada are negatively correlated with their elevation precluding interpretation in terms of simple erosive denudation. However, when additional structural data is included in the analysis, a complex denudation history is obtained. An initial phase of tectonic denudation was responsible for the cooling that produced the oldest apparent ages. Thereafter, folding accompanied by differential erosive denudation caused cooling of samples inferred to have been as much as 4.5 km below the detachment.

The zone is separated from the overlying Alpujarride Complex by a crustal scale shear zone that has variously been interpreted as a thrust or an extensional detachment. A suite of 74 new apatite and zircon fission track results have been obtained from the Nevado-Filabride Complex and these have been used to define regional cooling patterns for the complex. Rapid cooling (105 degrees C-200 degrees C Ma(-1)) is spatially related to the tectonic contact with the overlying Alpujarride Complex. Cooling to near-surface temperatures occurred first in the east (Sierra de los Filabres) during the mid-Serravallian (12+/-1 Ma) and was completed by the early Tortonian (9-8 Ma) in the west (Sierra Nevada). There is no correlation between fission track age and sample elevation. These results are consistent with tectonic unroofing of this complex, a finding that favors extension as the mechanism by which the two complexes were brought into contact. Extension spans the middle and earliest upper Miocene (12-8 Ma) in the study area and therefore lasted much longer than previously documented. A hypothesis is advanced which links oblique convergence between the Iberian plate and the Betic internal Zones, resulting in crustal contraction at depth, with orogen parallel extension in the middle and upper crust."

The ESCI-Beticas 2 deep seismic reflection profile, a transect through the core, shows a highly reflective deep crust overlying a subhorizontal Moho, and a fairly transparent upper crust and upper mantle. The lack of Moho relief beneath this area, with differential values for supracrustal thinning, suggests a mechanism of intracrustal isostatic compensation. Surface geology data together with seismic imaging indicate intracrustal flow and upward doming as a response to footwall unloading accompanying the middle Miocene supracrustal extension. A prominent mid-crustal reflector (MCR) is deemed to represent a decoupling zone between the upper and the deep crust. Subsequent N-S shortening and associated folding occurred in the late Miocene.

The hanging-wall block, known as the Alboran domain, has undergone more than 300 km migration from a more easterly position, where it was the continuation of the Alpine Cretaceous-Paleogene orogen. Contemporaneous with thin-skinned thrusting in the footwall, the Alboran domain underwent two episodes of nearly extension in which extensional orthogonal developed with directions of extension NNW-SSE system, orthogonal to the belt axis, in the late Burdigalian-Langhian to a WSW directed orogen-parallel one in the Serravallian. The superposition of these two systems resulted in a chocolate tablet megastructure. This extensional pattern is not satisfactorily explained in previously proposed models for the evolution of the are. Orthogonal extension is plausible in a process of the gravitational collapse of an overthickened crust; nevertheless, orogen-parallel extension is more difficult to explain in this context. We advocate that the WSW directed low-angle normal faults formed during large-scale extension in connection with important westward are migration. The driving force of extension in a general context of convergence is controversial and varies between a removal model and a delamination model. on both the timing and the kinematics of extension, as presented in this paper, seem to support the contribution of both mechanisms. Convective removal may have started the process, but continued N-S convergence could have resulted in westward tectonic escape and asymmetric lateral inflow of asthenospheric material accompanying lithospheric delamination."

Both interactions are influenced by zooplankton activity. To examine the relationship between algae and bacteria in Lake La Caldera, we studied: the correlations among phytoplankton, bacteria and phosphorus (P) dynamics; the ratio of organic carbon supplied by algae to organic carbon demand by bacteria; and the importance of P remineralized by metazooplankton for both communities. Phytoplankton and bacteria had a similar seasonal dynamics, and there was a significant and positive relationship between bacterial abundance and algal biomass (P < 0.01). However, the release of organic carbon from phytoplankton was usually higher than the bacterioplankton carbon requirement. P available via zooplankton remineralization satisfied between 74 and 316% of the minimum P demands of algae and bacteria. To elucidate whether zooplankton operate similarly on algae and bacterial growth or indirectly influence bacterial growth through phytoplankton metabolism, we performed zooplankton manipulation experiments. High zooplankton biomass in these experiments stimulated both primary and bacterial production, but release of organic carbon from phytoplankton declined. These results suggest a direct stimulus of bacterial growth, so algae and bacteria can balance grazing losses by compensatory growth. Further, the algal decrease of the organic carbon supply for bacteria could, over time, lead to a change in the algae-bacteria interaction from competition to commensalism. This reduction in organic carbon excretion could affect the balance of the competitive interaction."

P-T path modelling in different levels of an Alpujarride unit (the Salobrena tectonic unit) reveals a high-pressure metamorphic stage followed by subsequent decompression at nearly isothermal conditions. Nevertheless, the P-T conditions differ from one level to another. while the top of the Permo-Triassic metapelites includes carpholite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (10 kbar/425 degrees C), intermediate levels are characterized by Mg-rich chloritoid-Zn-rich staurolite-kyanite-bearing assemblages (minimum 10.5 kbar/450 degrees C) and the bottom of the Palaeozoic metapelite sequence presents gamet-kyanite-plagioclase-bearing assemblages (average conditions of 13 kbar/625 degrees C). Thus, the Salobrena tectonic unit represents an entire upper continental segment containing several crustal layers which underwent high-pressure metamorphism during Alpine continental subduction. The decompression, associated with an important mineral growth stage and the development of flat-lying regional foliation, reflects the thinning of this crustal segment, which resulted in parallel disposition of the bedding and metamorphic zones. At low-pressure conditions, large-scale folds affect the regional foliation, producing stratigraphic duplication, metamorphic inversions and the general reorganization of previous Alpujarride sheets. Finally, brittle Miocene extensional tectonics, coeval with the generation of the Alboran Basin, contributed to the definitive exhumation of the Alpujarride complex. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

At depth these data sets show evidence for a non-coincidence of the petrological and the seismic Moho beneath the Betics chain. The data sets reveal the geophysical properties of the Alboran domain (Internal Betics) and the Iberian Massif (External Betics). According to this, the Iberian crust features a relatively high seismic velocity, is seismically transparent in the seismic reflection images and is electrically resistive. The Alboran domain crust is characterized by a low average velocity, displays high reflectivity in the seismic reflection images and is electrically conductive. The outcrops of the metamorphic complex (Alpujarride and Nevado Filabride), showing relatively high velocities coupled with low V-p/V-s values (1.67) derived from the Wadati slopes, suggest the existence of rocks rich in silica beneath the Alboran domain crust. An interpreted detachment at 12 km depth imaged by deep seismic reflection suggests that these rocks could be related to the Iberian upper crust. partial melts and fluids are proposed to explain the high conductivity observed at deep crustal levels. These would account also for the reflectivity and the low V-p/V-s ratios mapped beneath the Alboran domain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

An analysis has been made of the biotic and abiotic variables involved, the location of and conditions surrounding the activity, as well as the strategies used by the ant to remain active at high temperatures. The results of this study indicate that the maximum activity occurs during the middle hours of the day and that the variable which most influences daily activity is temperature, especially at the soil surface. With respect to the biotic variables, the availability of food and the demand for food by the larvae strongly correlate with activity. The time outside the nest is usually spent in vegetation searching for food. This activity continues even when the temperature of the soil surface exceeds 58 degrees C. To tolerate these temperatures, the ant not only has a high resistance to heat (critical thermal maximum = 51.1 degrees C), but also increases the speed of its movements and resorts to thermal refuges. The present work contributes data on the biology of this highly thermophilous species, which is also capable of tolerating a long, hard winter and then developing within a short vegetative period."

The abundance of two insect species - a pulp-sucking scale and a seed-predator wasp - was surveyed with respect both to fruit characteristics and to viability of seeds contained therein. Seed-predator pressure was not significantly related to any fruit characteristics; however, pulp suckers tended to be more abundant in plants with low pulp:seed ratios and high fruit-water content. In addition, fruits with high levels of pulp-sucker attack tended to have higher water content. A multi-factor ANOVA, considering the identity of the plant and the attack of the different pests as factors, showed that plant identity accounts for most of the variation in fruit characteristics. The viability of seeds tended to be lower in plants strongly attacked by both pests. Fruits attacked by seed predators showed significantly lower proportions of viable and unviable seeds than did unattacked fruits. Seed viability was also lower in those fruits heavily attacked by pulp suckers, but this pattern is strongly mediated by plant identity. Pest activity proved to be clearly associated with a direct decrease in juniper reproductive capacity. This loss involved a reduction of the viable-seed number, mainly related to the seed predator, as well as a reduction of fruit attractiveness to frugivorous dispersers, related to the pulp sucker.

X-ray diffraction, conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and geochemical analysis of the soil solution were used, and the granulometric fractions gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, silt and clay were studied, as was unaltered parent rock. Most interesting was inheritance of dioctahedral mica (illites) with small crystallochemical changes. The transition of mica from parent rock to clay was characterized by small crystallochemical changes affecting their structural formulae, reduction of the 2M(1) polytype content, decrease in crystallite size, increase in crystal defects, and other changes in particle morphology. We propose the term 'pedocrystallochemical evolution' for the transition. The changes reverse the processes that take place in micas when rocks are formed by sedimentation, diagenesis and metamorphism. The kaolinite in the soils is a result of neoformation, and acts as the equilibrium phase within the chemical system. Reddening seems to have been caused by both inheritance and neoformation of iron oxides (haematite + goethite)."

The song of males in this species is very simple, with a repertoire size of one. The strophes of a male only differ in the number of elements that they include (strophe length), and strophe length is the main song feature differing between males. During the prelaying period each individual used mainly strophes of only two lengths, between 2 and 6 elements per strophe, and mean strophe length of males during this period was highly repeatable. However, some males changed the range of strophe types produced and decreased their mean strophe length after unsuccessful breeding or spending long periods of time singing (unpaired males). These changes show that strophe length is phenotypically plastic, and suggest that singing long strophes is energetically more costly than singing short ones. The significant relationship between strophe length and body condition, and the fact that long strophes were associated with longer previous pauses than short strophes, also suggest that increasing strophe length is costly. All these findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that strophe length reflects male condition in the Hoopoe, although it is not clear what the actual cost of singing long strophes is."

We have reconstructed a large, complex fold structure (which can be followed axially for over 50 km) based on a careful revision of the boundaries between lithological formations, a structural analysis of the carbonate and metapelite sequences, and the use of mineralogical techniques such as measurements of d(001) basal spacing of phengite, paragonite and chlorite, determinations of the illite 'crystallinity' index (IC) and b(0) parameters of mica and chlorite. Structural field data described in this paper include gently dipping axial plane cleavage surfaces, common occurrence of gently dipping boudinage and pinch-and-swell structures and associated sub-orthogonal stretching lineation, similarity in orientation of this stretching lineation with the slip direction of the low-angle normal faults, and close association between north-facing recumbent folds and top-to-the-north low-angle normal faults (the slip direction of the faults being broadly perpendicular to the fold axes). These features clearly indicate that extensional processes played a decisive role in the generation of the Alpujarras large recumbent folds. The development of these recumbent folds probably occurred during the Early to Middle Miocene extensional tectonics that affected the Betic Cordilleras. The formation of large-scale folds in association with normal faulting is consistent with the P-T paths and geochronological data established for the Alpujarride region.

The study was carried out in the Ojen-Marbella region where the Ojen and Los Reales nappes of the Alpujarride Complex outcrop. Ar-40/Ar-39 single-grain analyses of muscovite and biotite display plateau ages of 19 Ma, on the same rocks, Apatite fission-track datings give ages of 18-16 Ma for the last step of cooling below 110 degrees C, and confined track measurements indicate a very rapid cooling between 110 degrees and <60 degrees C. The combination of both data suggests a fast cooling phase at 19-16 Ma with a gradient higher than 100 degrees C/Ma between 500 +/- 50 degrees C and <60 degrees C. This fast cooling was associated with extensional tectonics accommodating thinning of the metamorphic alpine-type pile of nappes, The exhumation rate ranges from 1 to 3 km/Ma during the 19-18 Ma interval and is close to 1 km/Ma in the 18-16 Ma interval. Moreover an uplift of the Ojen and Los Reales units began after the Early Pliocene (5 Ma). The sediments sealing the strike-slip contact forming the boundary between the Alpujarride Complex and the Neomumidian Formation of Early Miocene age contain Early Pliocene planktonic foraminiferal assemblages (Zone N18). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of these sediments, actually outcropping at 150 m above sea level, indicate a deposition in the upper bathyal zone ranging from 200 to 600 m water depth. Our conclusions confirm and precise the exhumation processes during the 19 to 16 Ma interval, and uplift of the Internal Zones since 5 Ma. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Nearly 25% of the pluton consists of mafic rocks that mingled and mixed synplutonically with granitic recks. The mafic recks increased, thereby, the overall density of the pluton, added heat to fuel the upward ascent of the pluton, and helped to heat the wall rocks locally and sufficiently for them to deform viscoelastically above and around the pluton. Gneiss and a thin, concentric and conformable sequence of supracrustal quartzite and amphibolite dip steeply inward around all but the northeast quarter of the pluton, which is faulted. These wall rocks define a concentric rim anticline having a steep limb adjacent to the pluton, and a hat limb farther than 2 km radially from it. Previous interpretations of a rim syncline around the pluton cannot be substantiated. Sparse vertical mineral lineations, vertical necklines of boudins, pluton-up sense of shear in shear folds and associated steep faults, and appressed folds in the supracrustal rocks, all within 100 m of the contact, are relict, mesoscopic evidence of upward and outward expansion of the pluton during its emplacement. The macroscopic downward bending of the wall rocks and consequent formation of the rim anticline may be explained either by ductile return flow of heated wall rocks, or by late-stage magma sinking, or a combination of both processes."

There are four major controls on the occurrence of these landslides: structure, climate, topography and erosion. The tectonic control is through the structure and lithology of phyllites and mica-schists with strong lineations providing preferred seepage and failure planes. Climate controls the long-term, seasonal and short-term water-pressure heads. Topography controls the localised head-pressure gradients as a result of seepage and erosion controls the incidence of slope undercutting by fluvial action. The effects of these controls are tested using a hydrological budget model for percolation to ground water, a finite-element model for ground water flows and stability analysis for modelling the actual failures. The results suggest that in this mountainous terrain while climate may be very important for shallow failures, the erosional history and the consequent morphology are in general much more important except for the trimming induced by occasional very large run-off events.

The significant uplift produced, over 3500 m, has caused considerable thinning, detachments and gravitational slides in the Alpujarride units. The general displacements of these movements are towards the WNW to SSW. On the whole, the morphology is fan-like, adapting itself to the border of the Sierra Nevada. This border contains normal conjugate NW-SE and N-S to NNE-SSW faults, the latter also with sinistral strike-slip character. These faults have accommodated the uplift of the Sierra Nevada within an almost N-S compressive context and linked E-W extension. This sector coincides with the western boundary of the Nevado-Filabride complex and, in its southern continuation, with the western limit of the lower Alpujarride units, seeming to indicate a fault (or faults) reaching deep into the basement. Uplift has taken place unevenly over the last few million years, with three noteworthy periods: during the deposition of the Block Formation in the Late Tortonian, towards the Early?-Middle Pleistocene, and in the Middle?-Late Pleistocene. This has resulted in considerable deepening of the fluvial net surrounding Sierra Nevada at the present time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Four factors affecting the distribution of nests were analysed: nest density, intraspecific and interspecific competition, distribution and density of nest-site rocks, and the mode of nest founding. In general , P, longiseta shows a random distribution which is favoured by the distribution and high density of adequate nest sites, and by little or no intraspecific and interspecific competition for space. P. longiseta shows a rather stable interannual density in the study area, although there is some variation over the active period. Over-dispersion was found on only two occasions, coinciding with the highest nest density. The rocks are not a limited resource and their abundance and distribution have no effect on P. longiseta nest distribution.

The species of the H. memnonius-subgroup are characterised by an angularity of the female gonocoxae. Besides Hydroporus memnonius NICOLAI, 1822, this subgroup includes the species of the newly defined H. normandi- and H. cantabricus-complexes. The members of the H. melanarius- and H. ferrugineus-subgroups lack this angularity of the gonocoxae. The senior subgroup contains Hydroporus melanarius STURM, 1835, Hydroporus longicornis SHARP, 1871, and the species of the new H. necopinatus-complex, from which Hydroporus necopinatus sp.n. is described after specimens which have been incorrectly regarded as Hydroporus cantabricus SHARP, 1882, in the past. The H. ferrugineus-subgroup includes Hydroporus ferrugineus STEPHENS, 1829, Hydroporus sanfilippoi GHIDINI, 1958, and Hydroporus obsoletus AUBE, 1838. These species are characterised by their pattern of the elytra, and a newly introduced feature: the corrugated membrane of the median lobe is extended until the apex, this being in contrast to all other members of the H. memnonius-group. A key to all species of the H. memnonius-group is presented, and their habitus and aedeagi are figured, but only the species of the H. normandi-, H. cantabricus- and H. necopinatus-complexes are treated in detail. Some additional notes on the other members are provided, as well as on species which might be mistaken for species of the H. memnonius-group because of their external resemblance. Of these Hydroporus longulus MULSANT and REY, 1861, and Hydroporus nevadensis SHARP, 1882, are treated in more detail. Descriptions, distributional data and some notes about the biology are presented. Females of Hydroporus brancoi ROCCHI, 1981, have been described with matt surface; now shiny females from Portugal and Spain can be recorded. Hydroporus normandi REGIMBART, 1903, is recorded from Portugal, Hydroporus hebaueri HENDRICH, 1990, from Bulgaria, Montenegro, Hungary, Albania, as well as from Turkey, and H. longulus from Luxembourg, all for the first time. Nine taxa are described as new: Hydroporus brancoi gredensis ssp.n. from central Spain and central Portugal (H. cantabricus-complex), Hydroporus lluci sp.n. from the Balearics, Hydroporus normandi ifnii ssp.n. from the High Atlas (Morocco), Hydroporus normandi ifranensis ssp.n. from the Moyen Atlas (Morocco), and Hydroporus normandi alhambrae ssp.n. from the Sierra Nevada in southern Spain (H. normandi-complex), Hydroporus lenkoranensis sp.n. from Azerbaijan, and Hydroporus necopinatus sp.n. with its three subspecies H. necopinatus necopinatus ssp.n. from Portugal and northern Spain, H. necopinatus robertorum ssp.n. from western France, and H. necopinatus roni ssp.n. from southern England (H. necopinatus-complex). Lectotypes are designated for the following species-level names: Hydroporus obsoletus AUBE, 1838, Hydroporus longulus MULSANT and REY, 1861, Hydroporus celatus CLARK, 1862, Hydroporus productus FAIRMAIRE, 1880, Hydroporus cantabricus SHARP, 1882, Hydroporus nevadensis SHARP, 1882, and Hydroporus normandi REGIMBART, 1903."

For two years, we performed field experiments to analyse fruit selection by birds, offering birds different types of anomalous fruits (unripe, aborted, pulp-sucker infested and seed-predator attacked) and comparing the removal rate to that of ripe, healthy, control fruits. In addition, ne studied the proportion of fruits attacked by the seed predator in samples of fruits which, after manipulation and rejection by birds, we found lying underneath plants. We compared these data to values in samples of fruits which we took directly From plants. Finally, over four years, the abundance of predispersal-depredated seeds in the seed rain dispersed by birds was compared with the abundance in seeds taken directly from plants. Fruit-choice experiments showed that unripe, aborted and Fruits attacked by pest insects (both pulp sucker and seed predator) were strongly counterselected by these frugivorous birds. The proportion of fruits attacked by seed-predator in the sample of fruits manipulated and rejected was significantly higher than in the fruits taken from plants. For all study years, the proportion of depredated seeds was significantly lower in the sample of seeds dispersed by birds than in the sample of seeds taken from plants. Bird response to pests was not categorically to accept or reject fruit, but rather was influenced by pest density. Birds showed two different levels of fruit selection, depending on the type of fruit: visual discrimination, against Fruits that are unripe, aborted and infested by the pulp sucker: and within-beak discrimination, against fruits attacked by the seed predator. In the study, both pests either died or left the fruit when ripe, and therefore frugivorous birds did not interfere directly with frugivorous insects. On the contrary, insects did interfere indirectly with birds, promoting the rejection of pest-attacked fruits by birds. Bird dispersers overcame the predispersal interference of pest fruit damage and Fruit abortion and increased the proportion of healthy seeds in the seed rain. This fact, together with the great quantity of seeds dispersed by birds, reinforces the importance of birds as plant mutualists."

For this, we compared the age structure of these Mediterranean populations with those of northern Spain (Atlantic), and, on a local scale, the populations of different habitats within the Sierra Nevada. The populations from northern Spain showed age structures with high proportions at young stages. In contrast, the Mediterranean populations proved to be dominated by adult and senescent individuals, except for the few habitats with higher water availability during the summer, which have larger proportions of seedlings and juveniles. Dry habitats showed a lower seedling survival rate than did wet ones, mainly due to summer drought. Both the difference between Atlantic and Mediterranean categories, and the difference between habitats in Sierra Nevada reflect a serious limitation on recruitment of J. communis in Mediterranean mountains due to climatic stress imposed by summer drought. The Mediterranean populations provide a clear example of remnant dynamics, surviving for long periods due to great individual longevity which partially offsets losses to unfavourable environmental conditions. The low ability to recover after anthropic disturbances emphasizes the need for conservation of J. communis populations in southeastern Spain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system."

To test this, we studied the relationship between density and growth, mortality, and emigration of brown trout in two alpine streams and a set of stream channels in eastern California. We sampled trout at the scale of \"segments\" (5-31 m long riffles, runs, and pools) and \"sections\" (340-500 m in length) of Convict Creek over a 3-yr period. Trout were also sampled during 6 yr in seven 90-m sections of Mammoth Creek. For 2 yr, we manipulated trout densities in Convict Creek by removing trout from two sections and adding trout to two other sections. We also manipulated densities in seven 50-m stream channels, using a natural size distribution of trout in one year and underyearlings only in a second year. In both streams, average size (body length or mass) of underyearlings in fall was negatively related to trout density and was furthermore affected by sampling location and year. The strong, negative relationship between individual mass and density of trout could be detected at the spatial scale of whole sections, but not at the scale of individual segments. The Convict Creek and stream channel experiments also revealed strong negative effects of density on average mass of underyearlings in fall, and on proportional mass increase of yearling and older trout from spring to fall. In contrast, mortality and emigration were unrelated to initial stocking densities in the channels. In all our data, the negative effects on growth were most pronounced at densities <1 trout/m(2) and the growth-density relationships were well described by negative power curves. Large individuals were always less affected by increasing trout density than were small individuals, suggesting a competitive advantage of large over small trout that increased with density. We conclude that individual growth of brown trout in streams can be affected by trout density to an extent that suggests a substantial influence on population regulation. Results from our multiyear, multiscale, and experimental study indicate that density dependence in the growth of stream salmonids will be difficult to detect in purely observational data, especially in systems with relatively high fish densities (where the growth-density relationship has a flat slope), when data are collected and analyzed at small spatial scales, and when insufficient information is collected to assess the contribution of interannual variation in growth."

The taxon powelli is transferred back to Chamaesphecia, its original combination. Two new species, S. hispanica sp. n. and S. maroccana sp. n., are described from Spain and from Morocco, respectively. A key to the Palaearctic species of the S. triannuliformis and S. muscaeformis group is presented. S. atlantis is known only from the High Atlas Mts in Morocco from altitudes between 2000 and 2900 m. Its host plant is supposed to be an Armeria species (Plumbaginaceae). It is closely related and similar to S. borreyi and S. koschwitzi. S. borreyi is known from different localities in Morocco from about 400 m up to 2200 m. Host plants are Limonium species (Plumbaginaceae). S. hispanica sp. n. is represented in many collections but usually has been confused with S. atlantis. It is widely distributed in Spain and is also found in southern France. It occurs from the coastline up to more than 2000 m in the Sierra Nevada. It is closely related to S. maroccana sp. n. and S. triannuliformis (Freyer, 1845). The host plants are various Rumex species (Polygonaceae). S. maroccana sp. n. is widely distributed in the Atlas Mts in Morocco and found at altitudes between 1600 and 2700 m. The host plant is a Rumex species (Polygonaceae). Chamaesphecia powelli comb. rev. was known for certain from the type locality in Algeria only. Recently, it has also been found in the High Atlas Mts in Morocco. It was reared from the roots of a Nepeta species (Lamiaceae).

The gravels had undergone considerable modification during weathering in soil. A loss of the primary rock structure was detected, together with a decrease in compactness, an increase in roundness, color value and chroma. Neoformed kaolinite was present and relatively high contents of extractable forms of iron, aluminium and silica (citrate-dithionite and oxalate) were detected. From an analytical point of view, the surface properties (CEC and SSA) increased and the equilibrium pH decreased in the clasts which had undergone most weathering. The SEM study shows that the fabric changes from laminar schistose in the parent rock to other types in the gravels due to the weathering process. Electron microprobe analysis revealed the presence of phyllosilicates together with iron oxides in the illuvial infilling materials of fissures in the most altered clasts. These infillings affect the properties of the coarse fragments. The relationship detected between the properties of fine earth and those of the gravel fractions suggest that the coarse fragments have a significant influence on the properties of the soil.

The number of elements per strophe (strophe length) is the only difference between strophes of the same male, and the main difference between males. The function of this song was analysed in a colour-ringed population of Hoopoes in Granada, southern Spain, by monitoring the pattern of male song activity and response to an experimental song throughout the breeding season. Both spontaneous songs and responses to playback experiments decreased after the onset of egg-laying, and song production was not associated with feeding sites or nest holes. Moreover, some of the breeding males that had lost their females resumed singing, Males also used song to recover lost contacts with their mates. These findings suggest that the principal function of song in the Hoopoe is intersexual, for attracting females, and that, in an intrasexual context, its use is restricted to defence of mates. The dual function of Hoopoe song suggests that it provides information both for males and females, probably about male quality."

In several passerine species it has been shown that strophe-length is a sexually selected trait that reflects male quality and correlates with reproductive success. Here we analyse whether in a non-passerine, the Hoopoe, strophe-length of males is correlated with several variables of their reproductive success. Females paired with males singing long strophes laid their first clutch earlier, produced larger first clutches and laid second clutches after a successful first one more frequently than those paired with males singing short strophes. Moreover, males with long strophes produced more fledglings in their first clutches and in the whole season, partly because they brought more food for the brood than males with short strophes. The relationships found are not mediated by age effects. Previously we have shown that Hoopoe females in the early spring are attracted preferentially to songs with long strophes. Here we show that males singing long strophes also obtain postpairing benefits in terms of reproductive success, and that females paired with these males obtain direct benefits because these males provide greater feeding effort in the second half of the nestling period. These findings support the hypothesis that in the Hoopoe, strophe-length is a sexually selected cue under direct selection."

From the new species described only the ones from Ibero-Balearic and Macaronesian areas were taken into account (Iberian Peninsula and Balearic, Canarian and Azores Islands). The new species cover a wide range of taxonomic groups and geographic locations. During the 20 years covered by our study species were described from most of the insects orders and also other groups within the Hexapoda, Uniramia, Crustacea and Chelicerata. Most of the descriptions are based on material collected recently, and only a few use older material from museums or other research institutions. The description of new species is not restricted to typical high endemicity areas like the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, Azores or the Canary Islands, but includes many localities from most of the considered areas.

Rana muscosa have declined throughout their range in the Sierra Nevada and restoration plans require information on their movement ecology. Our study indicates that R. muscosa had different movement patterns and habitat associations during the 1997 summer period (August and September) compared to October when winter dormancy began. In August, visual surveys found frogs in 10 of the 11 lakes in upper Dusy Basin. During August most tagged frogs moved little (mean movement 77 m over five day periods) and all were found in the lake or adjacent stream where they were originally tagged. During September, movement increased compared to August Frogs moved from the original capture lake mean distances of 145 m, and moved cumulative distances of 315-466 m. By October, frogs were again sedentary (mean distance moved 43 m) and frogs were found in three of the II lakes in the basin. Moreover, mean home ranges (adaptive kernel 90% contours) also were different throughout the summer and were highest for frogs tracked during September (5336.2 m(2)) compared to August (385 m(2)); and October (52.8 m(2)). Before this study it was assumed that R, muscosa over-wintered in the deepest portion of the lake. However, most lakes were frozen when our study ended, and tagged frogs were found nearshore under ledges and in deep underwater crevices suggesting that at least some R. muscosa over-winter in these nearshore areas. In this study, we found R. muscosa in different aquatic habitats over the course of their activity period and that they readily moved between these habitats using both aquatic and overland pathways. The movements appear to be associated with seasonal migrations between summer and over-wintering sites."

Chlorophyll a, TN, and TP increased, whereas the TN:TP ratio fell substantially between the two periods, reaching values generally between 25 and 10 (by weight). On the contrary, DIN, SRP, and DIN:SRP ratios were similar for both periods in each lake. DIN:SRP ratios generally ranged from 5 to 20 (by weight). This ratio was low in the lakes with small catchment areas and increased progressively with catchment basin size. A regression analysis for the smallest catchments showed that chlorophyll a concentrations were not accounted for by variability in TP concentration.

After collection, the batches were stored singly in test tubes closed with foam stoppers under laboratory conditions at 20-25 degrees C. The number of eggs in each egg-batch varied between 37 and 312 and the length of the batches between 0.6 and 4.2 cm. Independently of the pine species infested, seven to nine rows of eggs were counted, wrapped around one pair of needles. A correlation was found between number of eggs and the product of number of egg rows and length of egg-batches (82% < r(2) < 97%). Oviposition almost always started from the base towards the tip of the needles. The egg parasitoids that emerged were counted daily, removed and identified. Later in the year of oviposition, after the end of the period of emergence of the parasitoids, the scale cover of the egg-batches were removed. One year later, all eggs were opened and the contents, such as parasitoid meconia and remains of caterpillars, were determined. The hatching rate of the caterpillars varied from 47.2 to 79.7%. The rate of parasitism fluctuated between 11.3 and 31.7%, but 44% of parasitoids died before successful emergence. Four species of Chalcidoidea were identified: Baryscapus servadeii (Dom.), Ooencyrtus pityocampae (Mercet), Anastatus bifasciatus (Fonsc.) and Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii and O. pityocampae the most abundant species, followed by Trichogramma sp. Baryscapus servadeii emerged mainly in June and O. pityocampae in April or June, depending on the region. For A. bifasciatus only males, and for B. servadeii females emerged except one male.

Three major mitotypes (designated a, b and d) were detected. Within Spain all mitotypes were found, gene diversity was high, H-T = 0.586, and this diversity was distributed predominantly among rather than within populations (F-ST(M) = 0.813 for the seven Spanish populations). Mitotype d was present only in the most southerly population from the Sierra Nevada. Elsewhere in Europe, populations showed little or no mtDNA diversity within regions, but there were marked differences between regions. Italian populations were fixed for mitotype b; populations from northern France, Germany, Poland, Russia and southern Sweden were fixed for mitotype a; while populations in northern Fennoscandia were fixed for mitotype b. The isolated Scottish populations were predominantly of mitotype a, but mitotype b was present in three of the 20 populations scored. In Scotland, UK gene diversity (H-T = 0.120) and genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST(M) = 0.37) was much lower than in Spain. When interpreted in the light of complementary data from pollen analysis and nuclear genetic markers, the results suggest that present-day populations of P. sylvestris in western Europe have been derived from at least three different sources after glaciation."

The call is composed of a variable number (mode = 3) of diphasic sequences. The first sequence is longer, and contains more beats than the following ones. The number of beats per second increases during phase I of each sequence. The time between phases is less than 0.03 seconds while the time between two sequences varies from 0.13 to 0.24 seconds. The call of I. nevada differs from the morphologically similar species I. grammatica (Poda, 1761), whose call has been previously studied by other authors. The call of I. nevada contains fewer diphasic sequences than I. grammatica and its first sequence is different from the following ones, while all of the sequences of I. grammatica are similar. These behavioural characters support the separation of both species. The male mating call of I. nevada can be considered to be a derived pattern of drumming, and one of the most complex known in Isoperla."

Thirtynine percent of the ant nests were abandoned before the end of the active season, 16% overwintered once without a change of rock, and 45% overwintered at least two years under the same rock, Rocks protect against extreme temperatures as well as serve as a supplementary source of heat, maintaining optimal conditions for brood development, Rocks thinner than 3.5cm harbored broods for shorter daily periods than did rocks thicker than 3.5cm. The statistical analysis of the mean rock dimensions according to the time of permanence of the nests, showed differences for thickness, surface and volume, The sizes with longer permanence were those with between 2.5 and 4.5cm of thickness and a surface area between 100 and 250cm(2). This kind of rock also proved conducive to the production of sexuals, Thus, for the fitness of the colony, there are suitable and unsuitable rocks. The occupation of the optimal rocks resulted from random discovery by ants, without the availability of favorable nest-sites (rocks) being a limiting factor. When relocation was needed because the rock proved unsuitable, workers relocated the nest under another rock without recognizing or learning to recognize suitable or unsuitable properties, Therefore, there is no prior selection of the rock, The thermal properties of this rock leads to abandonment (if \"bad\") or selection (if \"good\"). Thus this process constitutes \"a posterion\" rock selection."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0361-6525"	NA	"Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.

This dam, with hypolimnetic release, displays short-term fluctuations of discharge and nutrient enrichment in the tailwater during the study period. Breakdown rates of the four leaf species studied do not differ between sites, despite the higher dissolved nutrient concentration in the tailwater. This lack of differences is attributed to the potentially high physical breakage of leaves during peak flows that are of higher magnitude at the upstream site. The invertebrate density in leaf bags does not differ between sites, and Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera are the numerically dominant taxa at both sites. With regard to functional feeding groups, the scarcity and lack of significant differences between sites for shredders do not match the trend predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept in relation to the effect of a headwater dam. Possibly, the discharge fluctuations at both sites causes excessive instability of the natural substrate (leaf litter) for the shredder guild. However, as expected, the biomass of collectors colonising leaf bags is significantly higher at the tailwater, which might be explained not in terms bf quantity, but as a consequence of the higher nutritional quality of the fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) accumulated in leaf bags at this site, owing to the eutrophication caused by the dam. Despite the scarcity of functional shredders at both sites, at the community level, the leaf material is significantly more ingested at the upstream site, suggesting the importance of this source of nutrition for the trophic web at this site in contrast with the tailwater, as predicted by the Serial Discontinuity Concept. This also suggests that caution is needed in using functional feeding groups as trophic guilds to infer system-level trophic dynamics in streams, given the prevalence of generalist feeders among benthic macroinvertebrates in these environments.

This system allows the 19 movements of the instrument to run by using high-level software, a \"master\" board, and 19 \"slave\" boards. The Astrophysique Lineal et BIdimensional par REseaux Optiques (ALBIREO) spectrograph has three working modes and is installed in the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. We describe a low-cost system realized for the automatization of a multifunction spectrograph. It allows the control of a large number of motors: 19 for Albireo; the theoretical limit is 32 768! Another advantage of this architecture based on \"slave\" boards is to supply each motor with exactly the current it needs to reach the required torque (reliability and repetitivity of motions are obtained when the motor torque is at least twice the resistant torque). Thus, we can avoid unnecessary overheating which would be detrimental to the material as well as to the local image quality (seeing). The reliability of the system is obtained by software filtering the commands and also by using optocoupled electronics to avoid interference. For a complex instrument, the high-level software must be user friendly. The efficiency of the present software in this respect has been appreciated since first being used on the telescope. This system may be of interest to laboratories and observatories with similar needs for automation of motions. The adoption of this system will be supported by the IAA Laboratory, Granada, Spain.

These areas were obtained from an analysis of a representative number of this kind of endemics and compared with those from previous studies of other plant groups and different methodologies. The analysis of the distribution patterns of this group of endemics reveals a very high concentration in the Baetic mountain range, of which the Sierra Nevada is particularly outstanding, and in the Balearic Islands. These results are consistent with previous studies that used other plant groups (dicotyledons, monocotyledons). However, narrow endemics are of relatively little importance in regions commonly regarded as being of high endemism (e.g., the Pyrenees and the Hercynic arc: siliceous ranges that limit the northern \"meseta\" towards the West and the South). The same geographical units are highlighted in relation to the endangered or vulnerable narrow endemic group, whereby the highest values are seen in the Sierra Nevada and the Balearics, while that of the Pyrenees is notably low. The combined analysis of the areas of narrow endemics and the network of protected areas reveals notable deficiencies in the protection of rare and threatened flora."

In this paper, we study the effects of herbivory and the protective role of woody shrubs in the regeneration ability of the yew in the Sierra Nevada. The estimated density of the yew in the study plot was 287.9 individuals/ha, more than 90% being juveniles (seedlings and saplings), which were mostly located under fleshy-fruited shrubs. Saplings suffered serious herbivore damage when unprotected by shrubs. Thus, fleshy-fruited shrubs proved to be the best habitat fur seedling establishment and sapling survival and growth. The abundance of fleshy-fruited shrubs in our study site provides a yew population characterized by an active regeneration under natural conditions. We suggest that the maintenance of healthy populations of yew in Mediterranean mountains is strongly dependent on the conservation of well-developed fleshy-fruit understories and their community of avian dispersers.

We studied the selection exerted by several species of herbivores and pollinators in three populations of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae) in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over 4 yr by using path analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by the spatial variation in the relative importance of different interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in complex systems."

Specific objectives of the study were to quantify (i) the intensity of herbivory on reproductive structures of H. spinosa and the consequent loss of reproductive output; (ii) the frequency of herbivory, and how herbivory varied between years on the same individuals; (iii) spatial, among-population variation in herbivory intensity; and (iv) the relative importance of each herbivore species with respect to the losses in plant reproductive output. All plants of H. spinosa (n = 80) were heavily attacked by herbivores in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, where most plants were attacked by different types of herbivores during each year of the study. Plants lost about 50% of their reproductive structures during the study period. However, there was a pronounced difference in the magnitude of damage produced by each herbivore since ungulates accounted for most of the damage, whereas other herbivores caused much lighter damage.

Mountainous topography up to 2000 m lines the Mediterranean coastal margin of Cataluna (Spain) despite a crustal thickness of 22 km at the coast. Geometric analysis of topographic profiles indicates a strong link between topography and extensional tectonics. Trends in maximum, mean and minimum elevations show marked regional increases in a SW-NE direction along the axis of the Ebro basin towards the active Amer-Brugent normal fault. From patterns of local relief, characteristics of the fluvial drainage network, location of drainage divides, and degree of escarpment retreat, we distinguish two overlapping areas of mountainous topography, a southern area related to late Oligocene to middle Miocene rifting and a northern area related to late Miocene to Quaternary rifting. The youthful topography in the northern area likely results from mechanical unloading of the footwall of the Amer-Brugent normal fault. In the southern area (encompassing the Catalan Coastal Ranges), erosion continuously renews topography produced by rifting while causing headward erosion of coastal rivers into the Ebro basin. Elevated topography along the Catalan margin derives principally from flexural isostatic rebound due to tectonic and erosional denudation, causing exhumation of the rifted margin. Nonetheless, the height of the mountains and the thinness of the crust suggest an additional component of dynamic or thermal support of mountainous topography, likely buoyancy forces from density differences in the mantle."

In order to determine its frequencies and pulsation modes accurately it was observed at the Xinglong Station in 1998 and 1999, and at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Spain) in 1999. Period analyses were made for our data set (1997) and the data set (1997-1999). From the combined data set (1997-1999), the values of two frequencies are: 16.8493 and 23.0613 cd(-1). From our photoelectric observations, we obtained two physical parameters of SAO 16394: log L/L-. = 1.16, log T-eff = 3.92. We calculated the evolution sequences of stellar models with 1.00-2.00 solar mass in steps of 0.05 M-. and 8 physical parameters of each evolutionary phase. We suggest that the evolutionary sequence of the 1.85 M-. model might represent the evolutionary sequence of SAO 16394. The 30th evolutionary phase of the evolutionary sequence of the model with 1.85 M-. might represent the current location of SAO 16394. Depending on the Q values (Q(1) = 0.0336 day, Q(2) = 0.0246 day) and frequency ratio f(1)/f(2) = 0.7306 we identify f(1) (16.8493 cd(-1)) as the radial fundamental mode, f(i) (23.0613 cd(-1)) as its first overtone."

The study was carried out in July, and primarily focused on diet selection. Food availability, diet composition, species selection indices, and the effect of plant availability and chemical composition on diet selection in each zone were analysed. In the high zone, the availability of herbaceous resources was much greater than that of woody species, while in the mid-altitude zone, both resource types were almost equally abundant. Resource availability in both zones had a 36% index of similarity. Herbaceous plants were the predominant dietary component in both zones, and diet similarity was 51%. The greater similarity found between the two diet compositions than between the two resource availabilities revealed preferences for common species in both zones. The Spanish ibex selected food items with moderate levels in diet composition, a degree of quality (high protein content and digestibility) and moderate availability. In the high zone, the ibex selected its diet according to the protein content, while in the mid-altitude zone the food choice was mainly influenced by availability.

The taxonomy, distribution and habitat preferences of Chironomus larvae from profundal benthos of reservoirs and natural lakes in Spain are presented. The 114 water bodies studied were medium to large reservoirs and lakes throughout Spain, and were visited on at least two occasions (summer and winter). Out of the natural lakes investigated, Chironomus larvae were found only in one karstic lake (Banyoles), and to date, these have not been found in the high mountain lakes of the Spanish Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada, or in Spain's largest oligotrophic lake (Sanabria). 2. Multiple regression with environmental data from reservoirs showed that the density of Chironomus larvae was inversely correlated with water depth, temperature and sulphide content of the bottom water, but positively correlated with alkalinity and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content of bottom water. Thus, the density of Chironomus larvae was higher in shallow reservoirs from the eastern part of Spain (calcareous water and higher PON), but markedly lower in southern reservoirs (higher temperature and higher sulphide). 3. According to morphological and cytological characteristics, three species of this genus have been identified in the samples examined: C. bernensis, C. plumosus and C. nuditarsis. Reasons for the absence of other widespread European species are discussed. 4. Using canonical correspondence analysis to relate species and environmental variables, C. bernensis showed a significant preference for reservoirs with higher oxygen concentrations in bottom water and lower total reactive phosphorus (TRP) content at the surface than those reservoirs where C. plumosus-type were found. This suggests that the smaller C. bernensis prefers mesotrophic reservoirs and the larger C. plumosus-type (C. plumosus + C. nuditarsis) prefers eutrophic reservoirs. Taking into account the TRP/depth index for those samples collected at depths below the thermocline, and thus, where oxygen can be a limiting factor, C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis were present in reservoirs in which the index was low ( 1:800 for C. nuditarsis), while C. plumosus thrived in reservoirs with higher index values (< 1:20). These differences may reflect the preference of C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis for detrital material, while C. plumosus prefers phytoplankton. These observations are in agreement with the depth distribution of each species: C. plumosus was restricted to reservoirs less than 46 m deep, whereas the other two species (i.e. C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis) were found up to depths of 65 and 80 m, respectively. 5. Data from a transect (5-20 m deep) in Lake Banyoles are consistent with the general pattern described in reservoirs. In this lake, a high density of C. bernensis was recorded from littoral and sublittoral areas with abundant oxygen (above or close to the thermocline), whereas C. plumosus was scarce in several parts of the lake, especially in oxygen-deficient areas during the summer. This karstic, oligotrophic lake has a low TRP/depth index, and therefore, we expected C. bernensis to be dominant in the littoral, as is the case. Nevertheless, the severe depletion of oxygen caused by meromixis, and the high hydrogen sulphide concentration benefit C. plumosus in deeper zones. Chironomus nuditarsis was scarce in Lake Banyoles and only found at considerable depths."

The plant communities of the high reaches present greater specific richness and diversity (S(mean) = 7.0 +/- 3.4 and H'(mean) = 2.0 +/- 0.7) than do those of the middle and low reaches (S(mean) = 4.5 +/- 1.6 and H'(mean) = 1.8 +/- 0.6). One zone reached the highest specific richness (S = 12, H' = 3.2), which, apart from being situated in the intermediate stretch of the basin. represents a transitional state (ecotone) between the Salix and Tamarix communities. The characteristics of the waters analyzed indicate very high rates of erosion and runoff due to the nature of the soils (easily eroded marls) and to agricultural expansion and mining since the 16th century. The present-day riparian vegetation is not adequate to absorb the nitrates added to the basin by crop fertilization, reaching extremely high values, particularly during the dry period (between 1.2 and 42.5 mg/liter). Sewage dumping at three sampling stations did not appear to affect the specific composition of the woody vegetation, in the zones with watercourses, water salinity was low during the period of greater water flow, but considerably higher in the dry season (the upper limit was some 1.2 mS/m), resulting in a predominance of salt cedars over willows. Three types of saltcedar areas were distinguished: subhalophilous, which barely changes its chemical composition over the season; halophilous, which develops over strongly mineralized waters and markedly alters in chemical composition during the dry season; and hyperhalophilous, where salinity is extraordinarily high and quite constant throughout the year. A direct relationship was found between the dominance of Tamarix africana and abundance of NaCl."

These cold episodes alternated with the ones characterized by landscape stability and soil formation. Twelve soils that were formed on pre-glacial surfaces and glacial deposits of various ages were studied in four sectors: Laguna Seca, Lanjaron Valley, Mulhacen Valley, and Corral del Veleta. The soil parent material in all of these sectors was mica schist. Organic matter content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable bases, saturation degree, and pH, were found to be not correlated with the age of the surface. The macromorphological differentiation of the soils, their clay and Fe-d contents, and especially, the clay and iron oxide accumulation indices, increased with the relative age of the surface. In contrast, the Fe-o content and the Fe-o:Fe-d ratio diminished with the age of the surface. During the last few pedogenic episodes, soils were formed by strong leaching and acidification, but with very little chemical weathering. All of these features suggest that climatic shifts during the pedogenic episodes towards conditions less favourable to soil development, in addition to vegetation changes and disturbances on the soil surfaces, which started by periglacial processes, account for the soil evolution of the Sierra Nevada better than time as the only variable factor. The soils did not develop monotonically with time and the sequence of surfaces cannot be regarded in a strict sense as a chronosequence. The soils developed over a series of stepped pedogenic episodes; in each episode, especially in the oldest, the properties of the soils related to weathering could have approached or reached a steady state. Nevertheless, when these properties are plotted against time, a continued increase in soil development results. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Daphnia pulicaria was the preferred substrate for the epibiont, whose life cycle was exclusively completed on this taxon. The density of epibiont dispersal stage and the epibiont prevalence and burden on crustacean zooplankton were directly related to D. pulicaria density in both years. Laboratory experiments showed that attached epibionts had a negative effect on Daphnia by increasing the weight and sinking rates of infected animals and a positive: effect by increasing its reproductive rates, with a neutral effect on survivorship. On the other hand, the epibiont dispersal stage was actively and intensively grazed by Daphnia, which implies a benefit for Daphnia and a cost for K. gracilipes. Thus, both species derived benefits and costs from this relationship. Our results indicate a positive cost-benefit balance for both epibiont and host in such a way that a mutualistic relationship can be suggested. This epibiont-host interaction may play an important role in population and community regulation in Rio Seco lake."

Our results indicate large intraspecific variations in calanoid elemental composition. While mean N as dry weight increased from 3.0 +/- 1.3 in nauplii to 6.0 +/- 2.1 in copepodites, mean P content showed the opposite trend, varying intraspecifically from 0.98 +/- 0.26% in nauplii, to 0.87 +/- 0.21% In copepodites and 0.51 +/- 0.16% in adults. Thus, the mean N:P ratio increased ontogenetically from 3.3 in nauplii to 13.3 in copepodites and 24.6 in adults. Two ontogenetic parameters, the growth rate and body size, were associated with zooplankton stoichiometry. Among all II copepod stages, growth rate was positively related to %P and negatively related to %N and N:P ratio. A two-part analysis of these relationships, before and after metamorphosis, showed that the nauplii growth rate explained nearly all the variance in naupliar P content. A high P content in nauplii may reflect a high content of RNA, translating into rapid growth rates. Overall, these results tend to support the hypothesis linking specific growth rate with P content for copepods, but these results also suggest that the validity of this hypothesis is robustness when differences in the life history of copepods as a consequence of metamotphosis are accounted for. We suggest that the intra-stage variation in P content is associated with peaks of intensive metabolic activity during the process of molting in copepods, and we emphasize the importance of new empirical evidence to examine this hypothesis further."

SUBJECTS, PATIENTS AND METHODS: Contact tracing of the driver, 3 teachers and 49 students from different grades who were travelling from Malaga to Sierra Nevada (Spain) in March 1998. All the students from the ten grades where any case of tuberculosis appeared from April to December 1998 and all the teachers of the school were included.; RESULTS: At the school, 232 students were studied. The prevalence of the infection was 35%. A total of 12 new cases among the students were found. No teachers out of the 127 examined became ill. Out of the people who travelled by school bus, 2 teachers and 19 students were infected, prevalence among students 46%; five of those become ill. The odds ratio of infection for those having a class mate with positive smears was 5,5. On the other hand, the trip by bus (compared with those who did not take it) meant a odds ratio of 3,4. Most of the infected travellers were sitting in the bus close to the index case.; CONCLUSIONS: In this tuberculosis outbreak some of the students who became ill or infected were not near the index case nor friendly with him at class. Therefore is possible that in some cases tuberculosis was transmitted inside the bus."	"PT: J; UT: MEDLINE:11222175"	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"Spain"	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0025-7753"	NA	"Centro de Salud Palma-Palmilla.

In this paper, we study the effect of the association with shrubs on the ungulate herbivory suffered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ., Pinaceae) saplings in two isolated, fragmented populations in southeastern Spain. For this, we monitored herbivory on saplings with regard to the microhabitat in which they grew. We distinguished pines growing in open interspaces, on the edge of shrubs and within the canopy of shrubs, and also we distinguished four functional types of shrubs: thorny shrubs, nonthorny shrubs, thorny scrubs, and nonthorny scrubs. Our results show that association with shrubs increases the damage inflicted on Scots pine saplings. In fact, saplings growing in the open patches, far from the shrubs, escaped from herbivory more frequently and incurred less damage than did saplings growing close to shrubs. However, herbivory was also reduced when pine saplings were completely surrounded by shrubs, since then they served as a mechanical barrier. The type of neighbouring shrub did not affect the overall damage suffered by pines, despite the fact that the ungulates damaged the nonthorny scrubs more intensely than the other kinds of shrubs. Consequently, saplings have an advantage when growing within the canopy of shrubs; these constitute key microsites for pine recruitment in these Mediterranean forests."

All 720 larvae, 1,035 adult females and 994 adult males, censused in the field over 3 yr (1997-1999) and in 20 populations located along all the distribution area of the species were living on one single host plant, Hormathophylla spinosa Kupfer (Cruciferae). This differs from other Old World Timarcha which are adapted to feed on Plantaginaceae and Rubiaceae. Laboratory experiments confirmed these observational results; all 130 beetles tested fed only on H. spinosa, and no beetle accepted any other plant species either in choice or nonchoice experiments. Larval and adult preference proved identical, both stages selecting only H. spinosa. We suggest that T lugens has evolved the ability to attack an atypical host."

SUBJECTS, PATIENTS AND METHODS: Contact tracing of the driver, 3 teachers and 49 students from different grades who were travelling from Malaga to Sierra Nevada (Spain) in March 1998. All the students from the ten grades where any case of tuberculosis appeared from April to December 1998 and all the teachers of the school were included. RESULTS: At the school, 232 students were studied, The prevalence of the infection was 35%, A total of 12 new cases among the students were found. No teachers out of the 127 examined became ill. Out of the people who travelled by shool bus, 2 teachers and 19 students were infected, prevalence among students 46%; five of those become ill. The odds ratio of infection for those having a class mate with positive smears was 5,5. On the other hand, the trip by bus (compared with those who did not take it) meant a odds ratio of 3,4. Most of the infected travellers were sitting in the bus close to the index case. CONCLUSIONS: In this tuberculosis outbreak some of the students who became ill or infected were not near the index case nor friendly with him at class. Therefore is possible that in some cases tuberculosis was transmitted inside the bus."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0025-7753"	NA	"Hosp Clin Malaga, Serv Med Preventiva, Malaga, Spain.

For Chariklo, the absolute magnitudes determined from the February 2000 data are found to be higher by about 0.27 mag than the average in the 1999 run. This may indicate long period rotational variability and possibly a G parameter higher than the assumed value of 0.15. From the best sampled R-lightcurve obtained in the February 2000 run, no short term rotational variability was found. The V- R colours for this object in all runs are similar to previously published values. For 1999 UG(5), colours were found to be very red: B - V = 0.88 +/- 0.18, V - R = 0.60 +/- 0.08 and R- I = 0.72 +/- 0.13.

Results of these laboratory experiments were related to previous field data. Massive release and detachment of zoospores, which is the dispersal stage of the epibiont, occurred just before molting. A lower number of zoospores was dispersed from the discarded molts and a scant number dispersed during the intermolt period. Release of cysts, which is the overwintering stage of the epibiont, mainly occurred immediately after the molt was discarded. The production of dispersal forms (zoospores and cysts) shows precise temporal synchronization with the molting process in Daphnia. The colonization of uninfected individuals from infected molts and from infected individuals was rapid.

Sulpicius Gallus, Mare Vaporum and Rima Bode deposits. The data have been obtained at the 1.5 m telescope of Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain) by using an imaging spectrometer working in the 0.3-1.0 um spectral range. Principal features of these geologic units are: (a) low albedo, (b) localization at the boundaries between highlands and maria, and (c) spectral properties similar to those of the associated mare lavas. The image cubes have been processed by means of two independent statistical methods: the principal components analysis and a supervised clustering technique (spectral angle mapper). Using these methods it has been possible to identify the areas covered by dark mantling material and to compare the different spectral properties of the four deposits. In particular, two different classes of the dark mantle deposits have been detected on the basis of the spectra. New areas in Sulpicius Gallus deposit having intermediate spectral behavior between highland soil and dark mantling material have been identified, probably due to a mixing of the two terrains.

The inter- and intra-annual changes in the biomass, elemental (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and taxonomical composition of the phytoplankton in a high mountain lake in Spain were studied during 3 years with different physical (fluctuating hydrological regime) and chemical conditions. The importance of internal and external sources of P to the phytoplankton was estimated as the amount of P supplied via zooplankton recycling (internal) or through ice-melting and atmospheric deposition (external). 2. Inter-annual differences in phytoplankton biomass were associated with temperature and total dissolved phosphorus. In 1995, phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with total dissolved phosphorus. In contrast, the negative relationship between zooplankton and seston biomass (direct predatory effects) and the positive relationship between zooplankton P excretion and phytoplankton biomass in 1997 (indirect P-recycling effects), reinforces the primary role of zooplankton in regulating the total biomass of phytoplankton but, at the same time, encouraging its growth via P-recycling. 3. Year-to-year variations in seston C : P and N : P ratios exceeded intra-annual variations. The C : P and N : P ratios were high in 1995, indicating strong P limitation. In contrast, in 1996 and 1997, these ratios were low during ice-out (C : P  1000%), zooplankton recycling (9-542%), and ice-melting processes (0.37-5.16%) satisfied the minimum demand for P of phytoplankton during 1996 and 1997. Although the effect of external forces was rather sporadic and unpredictable in comparison with biologically driven recycle processes, both may affect phytoplankton structure and elemental composition."

More than 98% of the damage to terminal shoots was caused by goats and Spanish ibex in Sierra Nevada and sheep in Sierra de Baza. Some 72% of the tagged saplings (n = 619) were browsed during at least 1 year of monitoring (1995-1997). There were between-forest differences in herbivory pressure. Moreover, the herbivory pressure was significantly higher during a dry year (1995) than during wet ones (1996 and 1997). Overall, when browsing a sapling, ungulates consumed almost 30% of its apical shoots, and 85% of saplings were browsed more than once after establishment. As a consequence, ungulates severely affected the Scots pine sapling growth rate, and therefore browsed saplings grew slower than saplings unbrowsed by ungulates. Thus, according to exponential growth equations, the time necessary to attain a height threshold to escape from mammalian herbivores (150 cm height in our study forests) and start reproduction was retarded by the herbivory up to 12 years. Ungulates are a major factor hindering the natural regeneration and conservation of the last relict forests of Scots pines in SE Spain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

In this study, we investigate the mechanisms blocking colonization by Pinus sylvestris of the meadows. Two experiments were conducted in which seeds were sown either at I cm depth or on the surface to simulate dispersal, and three treatments of vegetation removal were applied: Disturbed (where the herbaceous layer was eliminated, exposing the mineral soil), Clipped (vegetation cut at ground level) and Control (no disturbance of the herbaceous layer). In addition, the effect of seed predators was controlled by using wire cages in the case of the surface sown experiment. When seeds were sown at I cm depth, seedling emergence was not reduced by the herbaceous layer. In contrast, when seeds were surface sown and predators were excluded, the rate of emergence was low in the Control treatment, intermediate in Clipped and high in Disturbed. Seedling emergence was, however, minimal when predators were not excluded, irrespective of the disturbance level. Seedling survival and growth after three years of study were similar among treatments. The results show that the seed predation and the physical barrier created by the herbaceous layer are the two mechanisms blocking the encroachment of Pinus sylvestris onto these Mediterranean mountain meadows, limiting the regeneration and potential expansion of the forest."

Nineteen calls from one male of Guadalgenus franzi were recorded, showing a simple call pattern composed of two beats with an average duration between them of 184.32 msec (range: 165-227). This is the simplest call pattern yet discovered in the Plecoptera. The female of this species also presented a simple call consisting of only one beat. The male of Isoperla pallida showed an ancestral call pattern, more simple than the other Iberian Isoperla species (I. grammatica, I. nevada or I. curtata, all of them with multiphasic drumming calls or I. bipartita with a notably different model consisting of rubbing). Calls from six different males (the female did not drum) consisted of an average of 65.94 beats (range: 25-83) with a duration average of 1462.69 msec (range: 548-1835), regularly repeated with intervals with a duration average of 22.27 msec (range: 17-30). With this study, the vibrational calls of all the Perlodid species from the Southern Iberian Peninsula, except Perlodes microcephalus and Besdolus bicolor, are known. Moreover, it presents the first record and description of the call of the monospecific genus Guadalgenus. An evolutionary approach to the vibrational communication diversification in the perlodids of the Southern Iberian Peninsula is presented, showing a complexity graduation from the more simple drumming calls (shown by Hemimelaena flaviventris and G. franzi) to the rubbing call of I, bipartita and intermediate drumming calls of other Isoperla species, consistent with the drumming evolution paradigm of Stewart (2001)."

These rocks originated by mingling of a low-viscosity rhyolitic sill with unlithified, wet sediments. Highly amygdaloidal (up to 80% vol., millimeters to centimeters across) rhyolite globules extend from the upper contact of the sill for several centimeters into fine-grained volcaniclastic host rocks. The sill is very similar to other rhyolites in the IPB in terms of petrography and chemistry. It is aphyric to very sparsely quartz-phyric, with small quartz phenocrysts. Vesicularity has been measured in the sill as vesicle area fraction, determined by point counting over a rectangular grid, and number density per unit area, determined by counting every vesicle within the grid area. Amygdale distribution, measured within the sill, indicates a process by which vesicles migrated vertically from the lower portions of the sill to the roof zone. We suggest that this migration process caused local density changes, large enough to allow the rhyolitic magma to become buoyant enough to move through the overlying sediments, producing globular peperites. Globular structures are preserved when rhyolite globules entered the wet sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

The average queen mating frequency (QMF) estimated from the sperm dissected from the spermathecae of 61 queens was 2.4 with 69% of the queens being multiply mated. QMF estimated from worker offspring in a subsample of eight monogynous colonies was 3.5, but the effective paternity (m(e,p)) was only 1.23. The difference between these values reflected unequal sperm use by the queens. Most colonies of R longiseta were polygynous and the average relatedness among workers was 0.35. Polyandry thus added only marginally to the genetic diversity of colonies, and our results gave little support to the genetic-variability hypothesis for explaining polyandry. Diploid male load was low, as only 1% of males were diploid. A large majority (92%) of nests produced one sex only, with males produced in colonies that had higher than average worker relatedness. This contradicted the predictions derived from worker control of sex ratios. Males produced enough sperm to fill the spermathecae of several queens. Thus, the results indicated that diploid male load, sperm limitation and sex ratio conflict are also unlikely explanations of polyandry. Plausible hypotheses for polyandry include mating by convenience, as the sex ratio is male biased and the mating costs to a female can be low because the females are wingless and have no mating flight. The observed unequal sperm use further-more points to sperm choice and sperm competition as important factors in the evolution of polyandry."

Using the marine Tortonian rocks as a reference, we have calculated a minimum extensional rate of 0.15-0.30 mm/year. The observed block rotation, the listric geometry of faults at depth and the distribution of seismicity over the whole Basin, indicate that this rate is a minimum value.

The flowers of this plant species were visited by very few insects belonging only to two generalist taxa, thrips and ants. Nevertheless, reproduction is not pollen limited in E. willkommii. Hand-pollinations demonstrated that this plant species is capable of selfing, reproductive success being similar in autogamous and allogamous crosses. Moreover, pollinator-exclusion experiments also showed that, under natural conditions, this plant relies predominantly on selfing, seed production being similar in presence or absence of pollinators. Selfing in E. willkommii is presumably an ecological mechanism to ensure successful reproduction in a harsh environment where pollinator availability is extremely low."

The work reported here analysed host utilisation by the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), the relationship between moth oviposition patterns and larval performance, the chemical characteristics of the plant in relation to the performance of different larval instars, and the role of these factors in the outbreak capacity of the species. In order to do this, a combination of field and laboratory techniques was used to study three pine species differing in nutritional characteristics. 2. Moths oviposited in the three pine species analysed, although cluster pine received a lower number of batches. Late-instar larvae were able to feed on all three pine species, however first-instar larvae developed on Scots and black pine but died on cluster pine. Consequently, oviposition in cluster pine can be considered an oviposition mistake, and indicates that moths are rather unselective when ovipositing on different pine species. 3. Chemical analysis of needles suggested that the quantity of nitrogen was the main factor responsible for the difference in survival of larvae. 4. The oviposition pattern of the moth and the larval susceptibility to food quality in Thaumetopoea pityocampa agree with the theory that unselective oviposition of the moth is a precondition for eruptive dynamics in phytophagous insects. 5. The success of the larvae depends mainly on the probability of the moth finding a suitable host. This probability is determined strongly by the changes of structure and coverage in Mediterranean pine woodlands, due to human management."

(Viscaceae). Arceuthobium americanum infects three principal hosts and has the most extensive geographical range of any North American dwarf mistletoe. Based on the lack of apparent morphological and phenological differences between populations of A. americanum, past researchers have found no evidence for recognizing infraspecific taxa. In this study, molecular analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis indicated that A. americanum is divided into three distinct genetic races, each associated with a different host taxon in regions of allopatry: (i) Pinus banksiana in western Canada, (ii) Pinus contorta var. murrayana in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountain ranges in the western US; and (iii) Pinus contorta var. latifolia in the western US and Canada. These observations suggest that host identity, geographical isolation and environmental factors have contributed to race formation in A. americanum. The lack of fine-scale patterning within each of the A. americanum races is attributed to random dispersal of seeds over long distances by animal vectors. Historical factors such as glaciations and founder events have also influenced structuring and genetic diversity in A. americanum populations. Given sufficient time, it is possible that these races will become reproductively isolated and undergo speciation."

Folding accompanied tectonic denudation developing elongated domes with fold axes both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of extension. The geometry, kinematics, and tectonic evolution of two major sequentially developed extensional fault systems have been characterized in several E-W elongated mountain ranges of the central Betics on the basis of new cartographic and structural data and a comprehensive revision of other available geological and geophysical observations. The extensional systems have an average WSW direction of extension and led to exhumation of the two lower metamorphic complexes of the Betics, the Nevado-Filabride and the Alpujarride, during the middle and upper Miocene (Serravallian to Tortonian). The extended domain contains a core complex, with distal and proximal antiformal hinges separated by around 60 km and with a fold amplitude of similar to6 km (measured parallel to the direction of extension). The total amount of extension across the core complex is about 109-116 km, corresponding to a stretching factor (beta) of 3.5-3.9, estimated using the distance between fold axial surfaces and a geometrical model accomplishing footwall deformation during tectonic denudation via subvertical simple shear. The elongated domal and basinal geometry of the detachments and their respective footwalls is due to the interference between two sets of orthogonal large-scale open folds, trending N-S and E-W. Longitudinal, N-S trending folds are interpreted as isostatic folds, i.e., folds that developed in response to differential unloading of the extensional detachment footwalls inducing ductile flow in the middle crust. These folds formed in a rolling-hinge anticline in which rotation migrates westward through the footwall as it is progressively unroofed. In contrast, E-W trending folds, being subparallel to the direction of extension, have a contractional origin and progressively affect to the west the isostatically readjusted segments of the detachments once they are inactive. Orthogonal folding occurred since the Serravallian to lower Pliocene. Extension is still active from the rolling-hinge anticline in Sierra Nevada to the west. The middle Miocene to Pliocene tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome at the core of the Betic hinterland is another example of the coexistence of extension and contraction during continued overall convergence and mountain-building."

The Baetic ranges in Spain have such a large number of endemic plant taxa that the territory has been recognized as a well-defined biogeographical unit. These endemic taxa tend to concentrate on disjunct highland areas that have been described consequently as 'highland islands'. Despite the importance and complexity of these sites, the research carried out so far has produced only descriptive classifications. These approaches overlook the relationships between the sites and do not serve to identify the main centres of endemism. Herein, multivariate analysis techniques (cluster analysis and reciprocal averaging) and the parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), applied to the 222 orophilous endemic taxa of the Baetic ranges, have been used to reveal the floristic similarities between the areas involved, to identify the centres of endemism and to re-assess the previous classifications. Four centres of endemism are defined, one siliceous and three calcareous. The most outstanding feature in the Baetic ranges is precisely the floristic difference between siliceous and calcareous mountains. Calcareous territories extend along a SW-NE axis in line with the oceanic-continental gradient. The nature of the soil in the vast siliceous and calcareous-dolomitic territories of the Sierra Nevada is probably the cause of the remarkable floristic diversity. Not surprisingly, in our analysis these areas stand out as centres of endemism. We conclude that previous biogeographical classifications of the ranges are too rigid and do not properly reflect the floristic similarities of the area under study."

Sex ratio (male : female) increased significantly with elevation, and above 2600 in it was significantly male-biased. The reproductive effort was markedly greater for females than for males at all elevations. However, over 3 years of study, the growth of the females, measured as elongation of the main axes, was similar to that of the males. In both sexes, growth decreased with increasing elevation. Neither size of the ripe seed cones, nor the number of developed seeds per cone varied with elevation. The percentage of filled seeds was significantly greater at higher elevations indicating more favourable conditions for wind pollination in these stands. However, cone production decreased with elevation and so, reproductive success of J. communis subsp. alpina in Sierra Nevada decreases towards both upper and lower altitudinal distribution limits. The results do not support the hypothesis of differential reproductive cost between sexes; thus, alternative arguments to explain the altitudinal variation of sex ratio are discussed.

The analysis of scats revealed a very important interspecific trophic niche overlap in the mesic habitat. In the xeric habitat the differences were significant and the overlap moderate. Seasonal variations existed in the degree of overlap, which reached its highest Level in winter in the mesic habitat and in spring in the xeric habitat. The results indicated that the availability of food in each habitat was important in determining the divergence of the diets. Thus, in the mesic habitat, competition could be possible, although it was not important enough to cause a habitat segregation. Martens seemed to be more adaptive than foxes, probably due to their smaller size and arboreal life, allowing them to exploit fruit which is not as profitable for the fox. Foxes based their diet on small mammals, carrion and cultivated fruit in both habitats. Rabbits were also seasonally important in the xeric habitat. The trophic niche breadth of foxes was higher in the mesic habitat. The inter-habitat comparison showed significant differences in the diet of martens. In the xeric habitat, martens centred their diet on small mammals and fruit of Juniperus phoenicea, Morus ulmifolius and Amelanchier ovalis, while in the mesic habitat their diet was very similar to that of foxes. The trophic niche breadth was higher in the xeric habitat than in the mesic. The habitat conditions particulary influenced the overlap of the diets and these variations were fundamentally caused by the different availability of small fruit."

This paper is focused on the Late Pleistocene and Holocene geomorphic evolution of southeast Spain, one of the driest regions in Europe. Late Pleistocene and Holocene chronosequences of river terraces were established for the Antas and Aguas valleys, respectively. The deposition of tip to four fluvial terraces during isotope stage 2 points to important erosion and accumulation processes at the end of Late Pleistocene in the Vera basin. In contrast to the stage 2 deposits, the Holocene terraces are composed of point bar deposits accumulated by meandering rivers with less sediment discharge. According to the obtained C-14-dating and extracted pottery fragments, Holocene terrace deposition occurred during the Atlantic period, early Middle Ages, Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century. The most outstanding site in southern Spain for studying Holocene glacier shifts (up to five end-moraines) is the Veleta cirque in Sierra Nevada, where the southernmost glacier of Europe persisted during the Little Ice Age. The climate changes of the LIA probably are recorded by two glacier fluctuations, as indicated by Pb-210 dating and historical data. The reconstruction of the evolution of the Aguas and Antas valleys stress that the aggradations of the lower terraces is mostly climate-induced although during the last 500 years, human interference in the landscape (Christian conquest, mining boom of the 19th century, etc.) may have played an important role to river dynamics.

However, the sex responsible for egg ejection and whether eggs are grasped or punctured are two essential questions that remain unanswered for most host species. In this paper, by filming the behaviour of individuals of three different species confronted with a foreign egg experimentally introduced into their nests, we first determine the relationship between recognition (when the birds aggressively pecked the experimental egg) and ejection. Secondly, we demonstrate that in the species where only the female incubates, only the female recognizes and ejects the model egg, whereas in the two species where both sexes incubate, both sexes eject the foreign egg. Finally, the large host species ejected the model egg by grasping it with the bill, whereas the two small species ejected it by puncturing it first. Furthermore, our data suggest that puncture ejection is more costly than grasping ejection considered both in terms of energetic and ejection costs."

Nineteen calls from one male of Guadalgenus franzi were recorded, showing a simple call pattern composed of two beats with an average duration between them of 184.32 msec (range: 165-227). This is the simplest call pattern yet discovered in the Plecoptera. The female of this species also presented a simple call consisting of only one beat. The male of Isoperla pallida showed an ancestral call pattern, more simple than the other Iberian Isoperla species (I. grammatica, I. nevada or I. curtata, all of them with multiphasic drumming calls or I. bipartita with a notably different model consisting of rubbing). Calls from six different males (the female did not drum) consisted of an average of 65.94 beats (range: 25-83) with a duration average of 1462.69 msec (range: 548-1835), regularly repeated with intervals with a duration average of 22.27 msec (range: 17-30). With this study, the vibrational calls of all the Perlodid species from the Southern Iberian Peninsula, except Perlodes microcephalus and Besdolus bicolor, are known. Moreover, it presents the first record and description of the call of the monospecific genus Guadalgenus. An evolutionary approach to the vibrational communication diversification in the perlodids of the Southern Iberian Peninsula is presented, showing a complexity graduation from the more simple drumming calls (shown by Hemimelaena flaviventris and G. franzi) to the rubbing call of I. bipartita and intermediate drumming calls of other Isoperla species, consistent with the drumming evolution paradigm of Stewart (2001)."

Over a 3 yr period, we monitored changes in the hydrological, chemical and biological regimes of a high mountain lake severely affected by a drought that peaked in 1995. During the drought, the decrease in lake volume enhanced the contribution of the sediment to the lake nutrient budget. The community became more complex, with the appearance of ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, organisms rarely found prior to the drought. The impaired post-drought recovery of the zooplankton, which did not reach normal densities for this lake until 1997, resulted in a microbial-dominated food web in 1996 and a classical grazing food web in 1997. Besides the species composition or abundance and the autotrophic to heterotrophic ratio, food web changes associated with the drought and atmospheric nutrient inputs were reflected in the stoichiometry and contribution of both bacteria and phytoplankton fractions to the planktonic particulate matter. Specific productivity measurements showed that cellular N:P ratios could be used to evaluate the growth conditions of phytoplankton but not of bacteria, indicating that an element other than P may limit bacteria growth. Assessments of phytoplankton and bacteria productivity and of the photosynthetic carbon release relative to bacteria demand in microcosms revealed that after a phosphorus pulse, the phytoplankton N:P ratio determines the nature of the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria as either commensalistic or competitive for inorganic P. If phytoplankton N:P is initially high (P-deficient algae), a P pulse can reduce photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) and bacteria can experience C limitation, whereas if phytoplankton N:P is initially low (P-sufficient algae) and bacteria N:P is high, increased PER is observed and competition for inorganic P may occur."

Further exhumation was achieved by W- to SW-transport brittle low-angle normal faulting, Subsequently these extensional structures were gently folded in the core of a NE/SW-oriented antiform during the Tortonian.

Uplift amounts and average rates can be estimated using the current elevation of the outcrops of well-dated deposits indicative of ancient sea-level positions. Coral reefs and coastal conglomerates record the initial development of emergent Belie relief during the Langhian. Continental and marginal marine deposits indicate the existence of a large island centred on the present Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain by the end of the Middle Miocene. The precursor of the Sierra Nevada-Sierra de los Filabres chain, originally part of this large island, remained emerged whilst the surrounding areas were re-invaded by the sea during the early Tortonian. At the end of the Tortonian the inland basins (Granada and Guadix. basins) became continental, while the Sierras de la Contraviesa, Sierra de Gador and Sierra Alhamilla emerged, separating the Alboran Basin from the Alpujarra, Tabernas and Sorbas basins, which became narrow passages of the Mediterranean Sea. In contrast, the Sierra Cabrera emerged during the late Messinian, suggesting a progressive uplift from west to east of the sierras south of the Sierra Nevada- Sierra de los Filabres chain. During the Pliocene, only the low areas closest to the present-day coast remained as marine basins and progressively emerged throughout this stage. The highest average uplift rate recorded is 280 m/Ma for the Sierra de Gador, although the average uplift rates of upper-Neogene coastal marine rocks since depositon have maximum values of approximately 200 m/Ma. Most of the uplift of the Betic mountains took place before the early Pliocene. The recorded uplift of Neogene rocks was highest at the margins of western Sierra Nevada, where peaks higher than 3000 in occur. The average rates of uplift were lower to the east of this major relief. The main sierras and depressions in the present-day landscape correspond respectively to the emergent land, in which uplift was concentrated, and to the marine basins that existed before the final emergence of the region. The altitude of the sierras reflects the time at which they became emergent, the highest mountains being the first to rise above sea level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Source rock types of the Betic Cordillera include metamorphic (mainly phyllite, schist, quartzite, and gneiss), sedimentary (siliciclastic and carbonate), volcanic (felsic to intermediate pyroclasts), and mantle-derived (peridotite, gabbro, serpentinite, and serpentine schist) rocks. The fluvial systems range that transect the Betic Cordillera are the major detrital source of sediment along the southern Spanish coast, supplying sand to beaches and offshore depositional systems in the Alboran Sea basin. Three key sand petrofacies derived from the Betic mountain belt reflect the main elastic contribution of known source rocks. All the sands are quartzolithic, ranging from quartz-rich to lithic-rich. Fluvial systems draining the Sierra de Los Filabres, the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra de Gador, and the Malaga Mountains, and their related beaches constitute a metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic sand petrofacies (Qm34 +/- 10 F4 +/- 3 U62 +/- 9; Lm72 +/- 14 Lv2 +/- 4 Ls26 +/- 13), derived dominantly from the Nevado-Filabride, Alpujarride, and Malaguide complexes. This quartzolithic petrofacies extends from northeast of Almeria to Torremolinos (southwest of Malaga), and northeast of Algeciras. Only one beach sand sample, east of Cabo de Gata, is volcanolithic. Volcanic detritus (mainly having felsitic textures) is derived from Miocene (15-7 Ma) pyroclastic sequences cropping out in the southeast of the chain. This metamorphic-sedimenticlastic quartzolithic petrofacies changes in the coastal stretch from Torremolinos to Marbella, where drainage systems cut across the Serrania de Ronda. Here source rock types include peridotite, gabbro, and serpentinite of the Ronda Peridotite Massif, and metamorphic rocks of the Malaguide and Alpujarride units. The fluvial and beach sands of this area are quartzolithic (Qm32 +/- 12 F10 +/- 3 U58 +/- 11), and include abundant peridotite and serpentinite grains. The latter quartzolithic petrofacies changes abruptly from Algeciras to Cadiz, where the sand becomes quartz-rich (Qm77 +/- 5 F4 +/- 2 U19 +/- 4). This sand petrofacies is derived predominantly from recycling of sedimentary sequences, mainly the quartzarenite turbidite units of the Gibraltar Arc (the Algeciras Flysch). This petrofacies is characterized by higher proportion of quartz grains and abundant sedimentary lithic fragments (Lm1 +/- 3 Lv1 +/- 1 Ls98 +/- 3). The three onshore petrofacies plot in the recycled-orogen provenance compositional field and the lithic to transitional to quartzose recycled subfields of Dickinson (1985). They vary from lithic, to transitional and quartzose depending on their source lithologies in the Betic foreland fold-thrust belt. These actualistic petrofacies best describe the nature and distribution of sand petrofacies derived from a collisional fold-thrust belt where primary and recycled source rocks are interfingered. Deep-marine turbidites of the Alboran Basin have basinwide quartzolithic sands having close compositional relations with Betic Cordillera onshore sand petrofacies. Comparison of detrital modes from mainland to deep-marine environments provides a suitable basis for interpreting the Miocene to Pleistocene sand dispersal history in the Alboran Basin. These modern quartzolithic petrofacies are used to interpret analogous ancient collisional sandstone petrofacies of the Alpine orogenic belt of the western-central Mediterranean region and of other collisional orogenic systems, as a broader point of view."

The Sierra Nevada, Sierra Alhamilla, Sierra de Los Filabres, Sierra Tejeda and Sierra de Gador, among others, are roughly E-W trending high mountain ranges, corresponding to antiforms where metamorphic rocks crop out. The surrounding depressions are located in synforms, where Neogene rocks are preserved from erosion. Field evidence shows that the growth of the folds is coeval with fault development, and that at least three of them, i.e. the Padul Fault, the Zafarraya Fault, and the Balanegra Fault, may be considered to be active seismogenetic structures. The Zafarraya Fault, in particular, is thought to be responsible for the 1884 Andalucia Earthquake. The fault is located at the northern limb of the Sierra Tejeda antiform, and could be interpreted as a collapse structure developed along the external arch of the uplifted fold. The Padul and Balanegra faults are located at the southeastern border of the Granada Basin and south of the Sierra de Gador, respectively. They belong to a set of NW-SE oriented faults that are mainly normal in character and indicate NE-SW extension. The set up, since 1999, of a GPS network within and around the Granada Basin and the planed installation of a new network in the Sierra Tejeda, will give us new insights on the present-day deformation behaviour of both folds and faults in the area.

Mountain ranges in the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordillera are exhumed massifs of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, and are surrounded by low-lying sedimentary basins. The Neogene history of mountain range uplift and basin formation in the Belies is well studied, but Quaternary topographic development and its relation to convergent plate boundary tectonics is less understood. Deformation, rates of stream incision and factors controlling landscape evolution on the flanks of the highest mountains in the Betic Cordillera are studied to gain insight on the relationship of Quaternary tectonics to topographic development. Specifically, geomorphic processes that led to formation of topographic relief within the Internal Zone of the Belie Cordillera are assessed. This paper is based on a field study conducted in the eastern Alpujarran Corridor (EAC), which is the eastern half of a 4-6 km wide and 80-km long inverted sedimentary basin. The Mid to Late Quaternary history of basin denudation is deduced on the basis of morphostratigraphic, geochronologic and structural-geologic analyses of oxygen isotope Stage 8-time fluvial deposits in the EAC. Results of these analyses indicate that climate and faulting played only a minor role in landscape evolution in the EAC. Instead, the EAC topographic trough was excavated by a drainage network whose axial stream (Rio Andarax) was incising at a rate between 0.3 and 0.7 m/ka since oxygen isotope Stage 8. This paper demonstrates that these incision rates are the same as regional rock uplift rates in the EAC. During the Mid and Late Quaternary, topographic relief between the EAC and adjacent mountain ranges developed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift. The implications of the results of this investigation are used to propose a model of Quaternary topographic relief development in the Internal Zone of Betic Cordillera. Topographic relief between Internal Zone bedrock massifs and adjacent basins formed largely as a result of fluvial denudation driven by regional uplift. Faulting also played a significant role in areas that are within a few kilometers of crustal-scale fault zones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

The glacier gradually retreated during the last century, leaving a large talus slope at the base of the wall. The unconsolidated material covering the ice masses acted as a thermal insulator. Recent bottom temperature of snow (BTS) analyses and drillings indicate that the ice still exists within the talus. Evidence from field observations made during the period 1995-2001. revealed that large mass movements occurred during the driest summers ( 1998 and especially. 1999 and 2000) when the talus was snow free.

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found significant selection on flower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the flowers. When ungulates were present, selection on floral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on flower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and floral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conflicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination. An accurate picture of the pollinator role as selective pressure requires the consideration of the entire life cycle of the plant as well as the ecological scenario in which the interactions occur."

We monitored the natural establishment of the oak for 3 years in two forest plots and two shrubland plots, by counting seedlings and juveniles. In addition, we established several experiments in these plots to examine acorn and seedling survival, while also considering the microhabitat effect on survival probability. Dispersed acorns were quickly consumed by several species of predators, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa) and woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Less than 4% of the experimental acorns survived to produce seedlings, even when they were buried 4 cm in soil, simulating caches. No effect of microhabitat was found on predation, and thus no safe site appears to exist for Q. pyrenaica acorns in the study area. Some 98% of the 1000 experimental seedlings were killed by herbivores, notably woodmice, wild boar, and domestic and wild ungulates. Seedling Survival varied spatially, being significantly higher under shrubs (4%) than in any other microhabitat (less than 0.5%)..Both acorn and seedling survival were much lower in the shrublands than in the forests. In shrubland plots, the main agent of seedling mortality was trampling by domestic ungulates foraging in herds. This study suggests that the regeneration of Q. pyrenaica forests in Mediterranean mountains can be limited by herbivores acting at several life-history stages. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The first group is mainly present in the Sierra Nevada environment and the Betic region (where remains of its stygophilic root P. beticus still exist), the second in the Vasco-Cantabrian region (where remain some relict populations of its root forms: P. ortizi, P. aragonensis, and P. ebrensis). Iberian species are generally endemic, either from the alluvial aquifer of a river (generally small or minute species), or from the aquifer of a karstic system (generally large epibenthic species). In contrast to all other taxa, P. lescherae is widely scattered in phreatic aquifers of the Ebro basin and adjacent rivers and typical of this large hydrographic system. All species, especially those of the 'ortizi' group, are strongly related to those of North Africa and the Aquitanian Basin. These countries together constitute a single biogeographic area. The Iberian Aselloidea fauna is the most interesting and diversified of the Ancient World. It includes a rich background of Stenasellidae species (ancient autochthonous thalassoid stocks, characteristic of the Meseta and Catalonia plates), then occurred the settlement by Atlantic' Asellidae lineages (Synasellus, Bragasellus), then the settlement by old surface Proasellus species (of Mediterranean origin), that gave birth to bushes of stygobitic taxa and finally the settlement of the recent perimediterranean Proasellus coxalis. But this fauna is still waiting for the settlement by the recent eastern invader Asellus aquaticus, which is currently invading the French Aquitanian Basin."

These populations are isolated in high mountains, which tends to protect them from the attack of a severe defoliating Mediterranean pest, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. However, as a consequence of climate change, the pine processionary caterpillar has increasingly attacked populations of this pine in recent years. This work describes the detrimental effects of defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar in P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis in Sierra Nevada. Defoliation strongly reduced pine growth as well as all the reproductive parameters measured (female and male cone production, mature cone size, seed production and seed weight), in addition to some deaths. If winter temperatures continue to increase; the pine processionary caterpillar will have a dangerous impact in these relict pine populations, by further reducing the pine's weak regeneration capacity. We suggest some mitigation actions based on managing habitat structure, in order to reduce or avoid such negative impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Iberian endemisms (Guadalgenus franzi, Isoperla cf. nevada, Siphonoperla baetica, Rhabdiopteryx christinae, Protonemura alcazaba and Leuctra iliberis) are frequent in the area, and among them Besdolus bicolor is particularly interesting because of its scarcity. Tyrrhenoleuctra cf. minuta is here recorded from Granada province for the first time.

Scat analysis (n = 101 faeces; n = 402 prey items) showed that the diet is based on rodents, fundamentally wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, Mediterranean pine vole Microtus duodecimcostatus and south-western water vole Arvicola sapidus. Results showed strong differences between the two sites (chi(2) = 74.04, d.f. = 5, P < 0.001), that is a predominance of voles in the mesic Chico river, whereas mice are predominant in the xeric Tejos ravine. Red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa and carrion also played an important role, especially in biomass terms. The overall diet differed essentially from that of the Mediterranean region, which surrounds the study area, since in these areas rabbits constitute the primary prey. However, the diet of the mountain wildcats is similar to that in the Eurosiberian floral region, despite its distance from the Sierra Nevada. In conclusion, the Iberian wildcat seems to behave as a facultative specialist, since it prefers rabbits whenever they are available, but rodents constitute most of its diet if rabbits are scarce or absent."

"Nest-boxes of two models (\"C\" or \"Tit\" model and \"cork\" model) were placed in the Botanical Garden of La Cortijuela (Parque Nacional de Sierra Nevada). Nest-box selection by insectivorous birds was studied during the 2001 reproductive season. Five species of insectivorous birds used the nest-boxes to breed: blue tit (Parus caeruleus), great tit (P. major), coal tit (P. ater), crested tit (P. cristatus) and short-toed treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). The most abundant species, P. caeruleus, used only \"C\" model next-boxes. Almost all the other species used only one model of next-boxes (\"C\"model in the case of P. major, \"cork\" model in C. brachydactyla and P. cristatus). Differences in the type of tree (Pinus spp. or Quercus spp.) preferred by birds were not detected. Differences in the preferences of birds according to the orientation of the nest-boxes were not found. Birds showed a tendency to prefer those nest-boxes placed in more open and sunned sites than those placed in more closed and darkened sites. These results suggest that the use of different types of next-boxes would increase the number of protected species using them."

The review of the literature on which we base this work extends from 1813, the date when the first article on Sierra Nevada fauna appeared, to 2000. In the zoological history of the Sierra Nevada, we distinguish two important events, the monographs of Rambur and Rosenhauer in the 19th century, and the entomological expeditions made almost simultaneously by Mateu and Janetscheck towards the middle of the 20th century. After 1970, with the founding of the Biology studies at the University of Granada, the number of articles concerning this massif notably increased. During the period studied here, 427 articles were published, 80% of which were dedicated to insects. In these articles, 356 new species were described for science, these also mainly insects. We therefore highlight that the interest regarding biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada cannot be focused exclusively on plant species or on vertebrates, groups which are emblematic for protection measures, but that the arthropods should be taken heavily into account for establishing protective measures for the environment."

Three years of terrestrial geodetic measurements are analysed to characterize the behaviour of these faults in a low to moderate strain rate environment. After the comparison of these three campaigns, we can conclude that there is no significant short-term movement of the Padul fault.

The occurrence of seedlings of Salix lutea (yellow willow), Salix laevigata (red willow), and Alnus tenuifolia (mountain alder) were negatively correlated with canopy cover and litter depth, and positively correlated with solar radiation. All three species occurred more frequently on sandy soils where the stream channel was wide and the slope was relatively shallow. The occurrence of Populus fremontii (black cottonwood) seedlings was negatively correlated with canopy cover, and sandy soils, and positively correlated with distance from the watercourse and solar radiation. Acer macrophyllum (big leaf maple) and Cornus sericea (American dogwood) seedlings occurred under relatively dense canopy cover, in low light environments, but were limited to sandy soils and wide stream channels. Results indicate that the hardwood species that exist in riparian corridors within the Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest type are variably reliant on conditions common to flood prone areas such as sandy mineral soils and a high light environment for regeneration."

Five of the 10 female ibex showed ovulatory activity with a mean (+/- s.e.m.) duration of the oestrous cycle of 19.4 +/- 1 days (range: 17-23 days). On average, the five cyclic females weighed 28 +/- 10.9 kg. Progesterone cycles occurred only in animals older than 4 years of age. Ovulatory activity extended from December to January. The duration of the breeding season was 43.2 +/- 17.7 days. Ibex females younger than 4 years of age had a body weight lower (P < 0.01) than that of adults and none of them displayed ovulations. Plasma concentrations of prolactin levels were significantly affected by season (P < 0.05), following a trend that was roughly parallel to daylength. The highest values occurred in the spring (119.7 +/- 21.4 ng.mL (1)) and the summer (139.3 +/- 19.8 ng.mL (1)), the lowest values in the autumn (26 +/- 7.4 ng.mL (1)) and in the winter (19.7 +/- 3.2 ng.mL (1)). Our results showed a very restricted breeding season, despite the fact that the Spanish ibex originates from and lives in a temperate latitude, revealing a remarkably good adaptation to the harsh climatic and nutritional conditions of their mountainous habitat."

Tourmaline appears in a variety of forms: (1) stratiform tourmalinites; (2) quartz-tourmaline nodules; (3) porphyroclasts in felsic orthogneisses; and (4) disseminations in psammopelitic meta-sediments and gneisses. Tourmaline within these lithologic groups exhibits textural and chemical variations that reflect complex premetamorphic growth under open-system conditions, and subsequent changes due to Alpine regional metamorphism. Microprobe analyses of the tourmalines reveal a wide compositional variation between schorl and dravite end members with variable contents of X-site vacancies (av. 0.084-0.225 apfu), Ca (av. 0.095-0.269 apfu), and excess of Al (up to 6.588 apfu) compared with the theoretical value of 6 in ideal schorl and dravite. The amount of Ca may be significant in porphyroclasts from the gneisses. Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios for tourmalines in tourmalinites, metasediments, and gneisses range from 0.34 to 0.95, 0.16 to 0.92, and 0.28 to 0.97, respectively. Na/(Na + Ca) ratios are also variable, mostly ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. Many of the tourmalines have complex chemical and colour zoning patterns, including significant fluctuations in Al, Fe, Mg, Na, Ca, Ti, and F. Based on petrographic and chemical data, three generations of tourmaline have been established. The first generation corresponds to magmatic-postmagmatic tourmaline that is represented by tourmaline porphyroclasts within the orthogneisses. The second generation of tourmaline formed during tourmalinization of psammopelitic rocks giving rise to tourmalinites. The third generation of tourmaline is represented by cellular textures, pale reaction rims and overgrowths developed during the Alpine regional metamorphic overprint. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Depending (amongst others) on the relative importance of these two factors, the margins of terrestrial sedimentary basins (where alluvial fans develop) produce aggradational, progradational or retrogradational stratigraphic architecture. We studied a total of 43 Quaternary alluvial fans in the Granada and Bajo Segura basins (Betic Cordillera, Spain). The analysis of their stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary facies has revealed the existence of three groups characterised by distinct stratal stacking patterns, which is the result of differences in eustasy and tectonics. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these alluvial fans and their drainage basins has allowed us to define certain characteristic geomorpbological patterns related, in each case, to the main mechanism operative in the creation of accommodation space. These patterns are described as follows. (1) Alluvial aggradation is the main result of high tectonic subsidence with the development of quite open, but small fans with a constant steep slope lacking incised channels and headward-eroding gullies. (2) In contrast, when the principal mechanism in creating accommodation space is low tectonic subsidence, progradation occurs and the fans are narrower and larger. Moreover, the slopes of such fans are less steep in relation to the drainage area than in the above case, being constant or even concave in longitudinal profile. They also have short, deep incised channels, culminating downfan in a depositional lobe. In inactive zones, long, deep headward-eroding gullies develop. (3) Areas of extremely low tectonic subsidence and base level rise produce very open fans in the sedimentary basin, although with a pronounced mountain embayment, which gives them a characteristic \"mushroom\" shape in plan view. In the latter case, retrogradation is the typical stratigraphic stacking pattern and the fans are quite extensive with respect to their drainage areas, usually showing a segmented longitudinal profile with a low gradient. The feeder channels do not surpass stream order 3, and various extremely long and shallow incised channels can appear. (4) Contrary to the case of fans developing under a regime of subsidence, when the accommodation is due to base level rise, the fan slopes bear no relation to the extent of the catchment basins. In such a case, the overall fan slope is strongly influenced by the extent of the mountain embayment because it determines the distributions of debris and sheet-flows over the alluvial surface.

Tens of small-scale normal faults crop out along the northern hillslope of the Alhambra, which have a N130-N150degreesE strike, dipping 65-75degrees mostly to the southwest. These are closely spaced faults (approximately 5-30 m) with centimetre to several metre displacements. Several topographic steps in this area coincide with hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults with the same kinematics as the small-scale ones. Some of these faults appear to be active and related to the present seismicity detected in this region, and associated with the cracks and other damage observed in the Alhambra. Several focal mechanisms calculated in this study are in accordance with the dominant NW-SE orientated normal faults. We interpret that the topographic steps of these faults are a consequence of repeated earthquakes during the past 800 ka. The last large earthquake of approximately 5.1 magnitude in this area occurred in 1431, destroying the Alixares Palace, the Arabian fence and part of the Alhambra wall. We consider the seismic risk associated with these faults to be moderate, as the displacement is partitioned into several hectometre- to kilometre-scale faults.

To that end, sampling stations were established, upstream and downstream of the dam. Quantitative samplings of macroinvertebrates were realized every month. The macroinvertebrates were identified to the maximum taxonomical level (species level in the majority of cases). The highest specific diversity was found in the Chironomidae Diptera. The biomass per species was estimated, as well as the life cycles of the predator's species, mayflies and dipterans. Gut contents were analysed and quantified. The diversity of the MIB was determined by flow shifts and prey life cycles. Rhyacophila nevada is the most abundant predator, with a multivoltine life cycle, and behaving as an active searcher of preys, ingesting them from the caudal region. The number of prey items consumed by R. nevada increased with its size. Significant differences on the diet between the sampling stations are a consequence of the shift in the resource availability of preys in time. The trophic niche breadth was different among sites."

"Citril Finches in about 250 birds have been observed in mountains of southern Spain in January and February 2001. Birds frequented large reafforestations of Pinus sylvestris. 98 % occurred above 1900 m asl in the snow-covered Sierra de Los Filabres, Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Baza areas. They fed only on seeds of Pinus sylvestris an were not found in other mountainous regions as in Sierra d'Aitana (Alicante), Sierra Maria (Lorca), Sierra de las Nieves (Ronda), Sierra de Bermeja (Estepona) and the whole area of the Sierra de Cazorla up to Sierra de Segura (Granada), where Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra are the dominant coniferous trees, which offered this winter no seeds. Citril finches occurred often in groups of 10-60 birds mostly together with Carduelis carduelis and C. spinus, feeding and flying together. Citril Finches often chased away C. spinus and C. carduelis from cones. We suppose this behaviour may optimise food-uptake. Citril Finches could avoid to fly on cones without suitable seed quantity or quality. Birds feeding on Pinus sylvestris seeds are not forced to gain lower regions in case of heavy snowfalls as they do in France. That's probably why we have no no recaptures from this area and we will probably not have in future. Our observations make sense to the two captures in Ceuta (N-Morocco) up to now isolated. Spread to Europe after the last Ice Age probably started in southern Spain. If Serinus canicollis is the closest relative spread of the species leading to S. citrinella could start from N-Africa. Thus the hypothesis which considers the actual migration ways as a result of the former ways of spread, is supported. To explain the actual range historical reasons of spread may be more important than actual ecology."

However, shrubs can facilitate the establishment of understory seedlings in environments that, like Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are characterized by harsh environmental conditions. In 1997, an experiment was set up in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southeast Spain) to test the use of shrubs as nurse plants for an alternative reforestation technique. Two-year-old seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra were planted in four microhabitats: (1) open interspaces without vegetation (which is the usual method employed in reforestation programs), (2) under individuals of the shrub Salvia lavandulifolia, (3) under the north side of spiny shrubs, and (4) under the south side of spiny shrubs. Seedlings were also distributed in plots with and without ungulates to test the effect of herbivore damage. We report here the results of survival and growth after four growing seasons, a time span long enough to draw robust conclusions concerning the suitability of this technique. Pine survival was remarkably higher when planted under individuals of S. lavandulifolia as compared with open areas (2.6 times for P. sylvestris and 1.8 for P. nigra). The survival of both pine species was also higher when planted on the north side of spiny shrubs, while mortality on the south side was similar to that found in open areas. The reduction of solar radiation by the canopy of shrubs was likely the main factor determining shrub facilitation. The growth of the pines differed among years. However, growth was not inhibited when planted with shrubs as compared with open areas in any of the years. Herbivore damage was low but was mostly concentrated in the leader shoot, exacerbating the deleterious effect of ungulate herbivores on pine growth. We conclude that the use of shrubs as nurse plants for reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success of reforestation in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and that it might be similarly useful in other water-stressed environments. In addition, this technique offers the advantage of following natural succession, thus minimizing the impact in the community."

Some of the data show that, in addition to temperature, other regulatory factors must govern these variations. Data support the explanation previously proposed for other insect groups that the individuals with appropriate development emerge at the beginning of the flight period or slightly afterwards, when environmental conditions are suitable, whereas individuals with suboptimal size emerge later trying to increase in size but under pressure to emerge during a specific period of the year. Nevertheless, our data suggest that maximum size does not necessarily coincide with the peak flight period (maximum reproductive possibility)."

A map showing the heights at which these Tortonian marine rocks are situated has a clear correlation with the present relief, indicating that today's relief has been formed since the Tortonian. There is also a good correlation between present relief and the Bouguer anomaly distribution in the Betic Cordillera, as well as with crustal thickness. Likewise, the present relief is directly related to the geodynamic setting of a horizontal N-S to NNW-SSE compression and an almost perpendicular extension, along with isostatic readjustment, existing in the Betic Cordillera from the Tortonian. As a result of these regional stresses, faults and folds hav e produced notable vertical movements. The highest rates of uplift of the Betic Cordillera coincide with large antiforms, in particular those of the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Filabres. Several subsiding sectors also exist (for example, the Granada Basin or the Guadalquivir Basin). The foreland Guadalquivir Basin has a complex history because the uplift in its eastern sector and subsidence in the western sector coexisted during the late Tortonian. Today the whole Betic Cordillera is characterized by differential regional uplift, even in the aforementioned subsiding sectors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Common reforestation techniques treat these shrubs as competitors against newly planted tree seedlings; thus shrubs are cleared before tree plantation. However, empirical studies and theory governing plant-plant interactions suggest that, in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs can have a net positive effect on recruitment of other species. Between 1997 and 2001, we carried out experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area (southeast Spain) with the aim of comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas (the current reforestation technique) with seedlings planted under the canopy of preexisting shrub species. Over 18000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area. We sought to explore variation in the sign and magnitude of interactions along spatial gradients defined by altitude and aspect. In the present work, we report the results of a meta-analysis conducted with seedling survival and growth data for the first summer following planting, the most critical period for reforestation success in Mediterranean areas. The facilitative effect was consistent in all environmental situations explored (grand mean effect size d(+) = 0.89 for survival and 0.27 for growth). However, there were differences in the magnitude of the interaction, depending on the seedling species planted as well as the nurse shrub species involved. Additionally, nurse shrubs had a stronger facilitative effect on seedling survival and growth at low attitudes and sunny, drier slopes than at high altitudes or shady, wetter slopes. Facilitation in the dry years proved higher than in the one wet year. Our results show that pioneer shrubs facilitate the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species and thus can positively affect reforestation success in many different ecological settings."

Despite intense deformation, the occurrence of skarn-like lenses (epidote + amphibole + garnet + quartz) and abundant post-maginatic hydrothermal tourmaline in both the gneisses and adjacent metasedinients strongly suggests that an originally intrusive contact is preserved. High-pressure assemblages are not preserved in the dated gneisses due to intense retrograde overprinting during exhumation. Nevertheless, thermobarometry performed in adjacent skarn rocks and metapelites indicates maximum temperatures and pressures ranging from 605 +/- 74 to 715 +/- 72 degrees C and from 11.0 +/- 2.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.5 kbar. SHRIMP ion microprobe U-Pb analyses were performed on zircons from one gneiss. The zircon crystals display igneous oscillatory-zoned domains, with an age of 301 +/- 7 Ma (95% c.l.), rimmed by dark, unzoned overgrowths of metamorphic origin (mean age of 16.5 +/- 0.4 Ma). The former age is interpreted as dating the crystallisation of the granitic protolith of the gneiss. This implies a pre-Permian age for the Nevado-Filabride marbles, traditionally considered to be Triassic, and a Palaeozoic age for the complete sequence of the upper part of the Complex. Accordingly, in western Sierra Nevada, the observed succession from the Nevado-Filabride Complex to the Alpujarride Complex (Permo-Triassic phyllites and Triassic marbles) can be considered normal from a stratigraphic point of view. Therefore, the present-day contact between the two complexes, the Mecina Fault in Sierra Nevada, is interpreted as a normal fault generated during exhumation rather than a thrust structure. The age of the metamorphic zircon overgrowths (16.5 0.4 Ma) is likely to be related to decompression, as suggested by titanite inclusions found in zircon. Titanite postdates rutile, the high-pressure Ti-rich phase. This indicates exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride Complex significantly after the Alpujarride Complex (similar to 18 Ma)."

We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded from ungulates. In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of ungulates depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, ungulates also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, ungulates can still have a strong effect on arthropod communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between ungulates and arthropods differed depending on the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained for a group of insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities."

We correlated a set of regional data of infestation by T. pityocampa upon Scots pine, from a broad ecological gradient, with climatic data for the period 1991-2001, characterized by alternating warm and cold winters. Defoliation intensity shows a significant association with previous warm winters, implying that climatic warming will intensify the interaction between the pest and the Scots pine. The homogeneous structure of the afforested pine woodlands favours the outbreak capacity of the newcomer, promoting this new interaction between a Mediterranean caterpillar pest and a boreal tree at its southern distribution limit."

Egg batches of the pine processionary moth were placed on four groups of Scots pines that underwent different periods of herbivory. The larval survival was related to the nitrogen content, fibre, phenolics and terpenes in the needles. Larval survival was higher in undefoliated pines, lower in pines defoliated two consecutive years, and intermediate in pines defoliated only one year, suggesting a direct relationship between previous defoliation and larval survival. In contrast, none of the characteristics of the needles showed a clear relationship with larval survival. The resulting reduction in larval number also affects the capacity of the larvae to develop during winter, because it hampered nest warming. Thus, previous defoliation limits, although it does not impede, the possibility of repeated defoliation on Scots pine. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved."

They were situated at 1460 and 2000 m, derived from micaschists and quart zites under Mediterranean mountain climate conditions with mesic and cryic temperature regimes and xeric moisture regime. These Orthents are weakly developed, as shown by their reduced thickness, their lack of diagnostics subsurface horizons, sandy loam textures, skeletal, and lithochromic colors. Quartz is present in significant amounts, particularly in the fine light sand fraction. Analysis of the quartz grains of the fine light sand by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and backscattered electron images (BSE) revealed the presence of significant physical and chemical alteration features such as fractures, corrosion gulfs, fields of etch pits and dissolution of intergranular surfaces. This process is confirmed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) since the edges of the quartz grains have a higher proportion of cations other than Si, compared to their centre. Further evidence indicates the authigenic nature of the process. Starting from quartz etching an assessment of soil weathering has been made (W index from Marcelino et al. (1999). The alteration of the quartz, together with the development of a ultramicrofabric with several fabric units (investigated with SEM), and other characteristics (mineralogical, chemical, etc.) are considered indicative of some pedogenic evolution. These facts are especially interesting in the case of weakly developed Mediterranean mountain soils from Sierra Nevada, where processes of chemical weathering have traditionally not been considered very active.

Core rocks record a clockwise P-T-t path with segments of quasi-isothermal decompression that do not cross the melting solidi. Doming was caused by the interference of two orthogonal sets of Miocene-Pliocene, large-scale open folds (trending roughly E-W and N-S) that warp both WSW-directed extensional detachments and the footwall regional foliation. N-S folds were generated by a rolling hinge mechanism while E-W folds formed due to shortening perpendicular to the direction of extension. Strike-slip faults striking subparallel to the direction of extension laterally bound the domes, adjoining highly extended domains to less extended blocks. Using a three-dimensional model of the crustal structure of the Sierra Nevada elongated dome constrained by surface geological data, the relationships with present-day topography, and the deep crustal structure, this paper explores the role of crustal flow in the origin and evolution of the dome. Collectively, the crustal structure, the rheological considerations, and other geophysical data suggest the occurrence of flow channels at two levels: mid-crustal depths and the deep crust. Flow in the upper channel is closely related to the mode of footwall denudation by detachment unroofing. The flowing channel in the deep crust is probably induced by the NW-SE crustal thinning pattern inferred for the region, with a relatively thick crust at the NW, and is likely to be oblique to the direction of extension in the upper crust. A geometric model assuming footwall deformation by subvertical simple shear examines the possible exhumation paths of the lower-plate rocks and the evolution of the dome core in the upper crust during extension. In this model, the dome width measured parallel to the direction of extension can be used to estimate the amount of horizontal extension, once the dip of the non-readjusted segment of the detachment is well constrained. Finally, we also discuss two interesting associated problems common in extensional tectonics; namely, ( 1) what causes mountain uplift in recently extended continental terrains? and ( 2) what holds up high mountain belts in these regions where the Moho is often subhorizontal? A rolling hinge model and simultaneous transverse shortening can explain the high values of extension, the orthogonal folding, and the high mountains in the Sierra Nevada elongated dome. Flow beneath the dome of a relatively low-velocity, highly conductive, and probably low-density crustal material can support the high topography."

Since this was inferred from a genus-level phylogenetic analysis, the aim of this study was to check for the occurrence of such structure and the validity of the proposed model at a local scale, in a southern Spanish massif (Sierra Nevada), as well as to examine the evolutionary implications at the organism level. Methods: In addition to 117 sequences of direct PCR products from genomic DNA, 50 sequences of PCR products from cloned DNA were obtained to analyse cases of intragenomic polymorphisms for the ITS regions. Key Results: Sequence data confirm the occurrence of a species-independent structure at a local scale and reveal insights through the analysis of contact areas between different ITS copies (ribotypes). A comparison between cloned and direct sequences (a) confirms that, within these contact areas, ITS copies co-occur both in different individuals and within single genomes; and (b) reveals recombination between different copies. Conclusions: This study supports the utility of direct sequences for detecting intra-individual polymorphism and for partially inferring the ITS copies involved, given previous knowledge of the variability. The main evolutionary implication at the organism level is that gene-flow and concerted evolution shape the geographic structure of ITS variation."

The Lujar syncline and, probably, the associated recumbent anticline which crops out southeast of Sierra de Lujar show a great variation in the orientation of the hinge line. Although having a curved shape, the hinge line is contained in a plane whose attitude coincides with the main attitude of the axial-plane crenulation foliation (Sc), suggesting that it is a sheath fold. The strongly deformed overturned limb of the syncline is cut by two low-angle normal faults displacing towards the north. Similarity in the kinematics between the faults and the fold, and the association between the faults and the high-strain zone in the overturned limb of the fold, suggest that they are related. Regional constraints on the age of the crenulation cleavage and the low-angle normal faults indicate that they formed during the early Miocene late-orogenic extensional event in the Alboran Domain. We propose an alternate explanation for the structure of the Alpujarras region in which the Lujar syncline forms part of a recumbent syncline-anticline pair that extends along much of the Alpujarride outcrop in the southern Betic Cordillera. In several places, the fold is disrupted by low-angle normal faults, and it is overlain by an upper Alpujirride extensional sheet mainly composed of medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks. We suggest that all these structures arose from the extensional deformation under decreasing temperature conditions of a previously thickened and metamorphosed orogenic crust. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Perpendicular directions of extension in metamorphic domes and nearby sedimentary basins remain unexplained. This paper puts kinematic constraints on the final exhumation of the Nevado-Filabride complex, focusing on the formation of metamorphic domes and their relations with the adjacent basins. Structural fabrics and kinematic indicators below the main shear zones as well as their relations with both published changing metamorphic P-T conditions and geochronological data were studied. Our approach describes (1) a consistent top-to-the-west shear parallel to dome axes of during D2 (i.e., during decompression) with distributed ductile flow and the onset of strain localization along major shear zones, (2) further strain localization along the major shear zones under greenschist facies conditions, during D3 leading to S-C' mylonites formation accompanied with a rock strong thickness reduction, (3) the divergence of shear direction on either limbs of domes during D3 showing the appearance of the dome geometry, and (4) a local evolution toward N-S brittle extension (D4) in the upper plate and formation of sedimentary basins. Continuous ductile to brittle top-to-the-west shear is compatible with the slab retreat hypothesis from the Miocene; the formation of domes which adds gravitational forces responsible for the final stages of exhumation is thus characterized by important kinematics changes necessary to explain coeval N-S opened basins. Later, from the upper Tortonian, a contractional event (D5) amplified the earlier domal structures forming the present north vergent folds. Citation: Augier, R., L. Jolivet, and C.

During baseflow conditions, nitrate and ammonium had opposite behaviour, probably controlled by biological processes such as vegetation uptake and mineralization activity. DON concentrations did not have a seasonal trend. During storms, nitrate and DON increased by several times but discharge was not a good predictor of nutrient concentrations. DOC:DON ratios in streamwater were around 26, except during the months following drought when DOC:DON ratios ranged between 42 and 20 during baseflow and stormflow conditions, respectively. Annual N export during 2000-2001 was 70 kg km(-1) year(-1), of which 75% was delivered during stormflow.

The biometrics of cinclus in the north and centre were similar but aquaticus was larger in the south than the north.

This similarity is not related to restite unmixing, as indicated by the igneous textures of the enclaves. A number of other geological and geochemical lines of evidence, including the high REE and HFSE contents of the microgranular enclaves relative to the host granitoid, strongly suggest that this similarity cannot be explained by magma mixing. Alternatively, a crystallization process by rapid cooling within the host granitoid magma could explain the geochemical and textural characteristics of the microgranular enclaves, including shape, grain size, mineralogy, texture, chemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic composition. Such a crystallization occurred at the walls of the magma conduits through which the granitic magmas were emplaced in the upper crust. This process should be considered as an alternative hypothesis to magma mixing for the generation of some microgranular enclaves, especially where no direct evidence exists for the presence of basic magmas coeval with granitoids, and where there is a lack of isotopic contrast between hosts and enclaves. As the process is favoured by feeder-dyke related emplacement, we suggest that abundance of microgranular enclaves can be related to the mechanism of emplacement of granitoid bodies."

Location: Two successional montane shrublands at the Sierra Nevada Protected Area, SE Spain. Method: Seedlings of Quercus and Pinus species were planted in four experimental treatments: (1) under shrubs; (2) in open interspaces without vegetation; (3) under shrubs where the canopies were removed-, (4) in open interspaces but covering seedlings with branches, mimicking a shrub canopy. Results: Both effects benefited seedling performance. However, rnicroclimatic amelioration due to canopy shading had the strongest effect, which was particularly pronounced in the drier site. Below-ground, shrubs did not modify soil physical characteristics, organic matter, total N and P, or, water content, but significantly increased available K, which has been shown to improve seedling water-Use efficiency under drought conditions. Conclusions: We propose that in Mediterranean montane ecosystems, characterised by a severe summer drought, pioneer shrubs represent a major safe site for tree early recruitment during secondary succession, improving seedling survival during summer by the modification of both the above- and below-ground environment."

However, little empirical information exists on the real effect that these organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year) ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E. baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was nonsignificant, although > 50% of Erysimum seedlings died due to ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species. Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat distribution and niche structure."

Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from herbivores. Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and herbivores affected plant fitness, but their effects were not independent. Herbivores only had a detrimental effect on plant fitness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced fitness only when herbivores were excluded. This outcome demonstrates that the importance of pollinators for plant fitness depends on the occurrence of herbivores, and suggests that herbivores may hamper pollinator-mediated adaptation in plants."

"This paper experimentally examines the relationship between ungulates and arthropods associated with two common shrub species (Astragalus granatensis Lam. and Genista versicolor- Boiss.) in the high mountains of Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). During two years we studied the effect of ungulate removal on the abundance, biomass, and diversity of arthropod families and beetle species. In general, our results have shown that ungulates significantly affected the arthropods living in the two studied shrub species. Ungulates affected arthropod community traits, this effect being evident mainly on arthropod and beetle diversity. However, we cannot draw conclusions about the positive or negative effect of browsing in our study area, because at each taxonomic level (arthropod families vs. beetle species) arthropods responded to ungulates in a different way. In addition, the effect of ungulates on arthropods and beetles differed between sites, years and sampling periods. Moreover, there were also complex responses of arthropods at family and species levels in relation to temporal variability, pointing out the necessity of conducting long-term studies to accurately determine the actual effect of grazing on arthropod communities."

Metapopulation dynamics should be more important at the borders of species distributions due to two main factors: (1) populations are less abundant and fluctuate more at the borders than in the centre of their distributions, and (2) resources in the range margins of species distributions are often more scarce and fragmented. 2. Most metapopulation studies have been performed in a fraction of the entire distribution of species. The main goal here is to study the population dynamics of a narrowly distributed species including both the borders and the centre of the distribution, and to test the predictions described above. 3. The density and extinction events in a patchily distributed species, Timarcha lugens, was quantified for 5 years along an altitudinal gradient including the upper and lower limits of the species distribution. The dispersal ability of Timarcha was also studied using a mark-release-recapture study. 4. Extinction events and empty patches were only found at the borders of Timarcha distribution. The fluctuation in beetle density was greater in patches suffering extinction events. Resource abundance was negatively related to beetle density and positively related to extinction events. In addition, the dispersal rate among patches was very low and beetles moved distances of no further than 25 in. 5. Population density governs the extinction events in this system, and its fluctuation was more evident near the border of the distribution. Both factors together with the relative population stability in patches at medium and high altitudes, and the low dispersal rate of the individuals support the idea of a source-sink metapopulation structure in T. lugens."

Although the role of spatial pattern in models on metapopulation dynamics has recently been recognized, there is a lack of empirical studies accounting for the consequences of considering autocorrelation in these processes. Here, we show that the conventional statistical methods used for determining the factors controlling species population dynamics (species density, sex ratio, and extinction events) can be strongly affected by spatial autocorrelation. Under these circumstances, the use of a spatially explicit model is highly recommended in order to demonstrate the real factor controlling species population dynamics. Moreover, presenting erroneous conclusions concerning the real factors governing species population dynamics could have far-reaching consequences in the management and conservation of many endangered species."

Bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), generated by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain-reaction-amplified 16S rRNA genes, were used as a surrogate of predominant \"biodiversity units.\" OTU composition among lakes was heterogeneous, and the number of site-specific OTUs was near 50%. Lake remoteness did not affect the number of bacterial OTUs although the spatial distribution of the lakes significantly influenced bacterial composition. Lakes that were closer together had more similar bacterial fingerprints. We found a consistent positive association between bacterial OTU richness and lake area.

We studied the strategy used by Rossomyrmex minuchae queens to invade their host Proformica longiseta. Field observations revealed that queens enter the host nest unchallenged by the host workers in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Pre-usurpation queens were found to possess a highly inflated Dufour's gland, which considerably reduces in size after successful usurpation. Chemical analysis of these queen glands revealed tetradecanal to be the major product in pre-usurpation Rossomyrmex queens, but to be almost absent in queens that have been adopted by P. longiseta. We consequently hypothesized that tetradecanal is a repellent that is used by queens to prevent host worker aggression. We tested its repellent effect by attempting to deter starved, highly motivated workers from a droplet of honey. Tetradecanal indeed proved to be highly repellent both to host worker P. longiseta and non-host worker Formica selysi. It was even more powerful than limonene, a reported general ant repellent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that R. minuchae queens use Dufour's gland secretion as a weapon during nest usurpation. The general use of tetradecanal as a defensive compound, and its seemingly non-specific repellent effect on ants, indicate that it may act as a general ant repellent. Its adoption by R. minuchae queens thus provides them with an efficient defensive and offensive chemical weapon during their long and risky search for new host nests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The mating behaviour of the entire genus Rossomyrmex is virtually unknown. We present here the results of a 3-year study of mating behaviour in R. minuchae. Behavioural observations and limited nest excavations revealed that R. minuchae does not produce sexuals every year, the number of sexuals is low, and the sex ratio tends to be female biased. Females typically exhibit two distinct activity periods. The first, the mating period, takes place in early afternoon: the ants \"call\" near the natal nest, mate and then return to their nest. The second, the dispersal period takes place in late afternoon: the mated females exit their nest and fly in search of a new, non-parasitized Proformica longiseta host nest. Males are highly active during the mating period, but will remain inactive in the dispersal period even if experimentally presented with virgin females. It appears that females are monogamous, while males are polygamous. When males are late arriving at the female calling site, the females will frequently congregate presumably calling in chorus. The low reproductive efficiency exhibited by R. minuchae, coupled with the postulated low genetic variation in the population, as sisters may mate with the same male, could result in a low survival rate and risk of eventual extinction. The observed decrease in nest density we observed during the 2004 season may be indicative of such a process."

Spain) record the high-pressure dehydration of antigorite-olivine serpentinite to form chlorite harzburgite (ol + opx + chl). In the field, these two rock types are separated by a well-defined isograd. Titanian clinohumite (TiCl) and olivine show textural and compositional differences depending on the rock type. OH-TiCl occurs in the serpentinite as disseminated grains and in veins. F-OH-TiCl is observed exclusively in the chlorite harzburgite, where it occurs as porphyroblastic grains and within prograde olivine as irregular and lamellar, planar intergrowths at microscopic and submicroscopic scales. Petrological evidence of partial to complete breakdown of TiCl to olivine + ilmenite is preserved in both rock types. Chlorite harzburgite is characterized by a brown pleochroic olivine with abundantally oriented microscopic to submicroscopic oxide particles. The mean Ti-content of the brown olivine is 144 ppm. The brown olivine preserves TiCl lamellae that sometimes grade into ghost lamellae outlined by the oxide trails. This observation suggests that some of the oxide inclusions in the brown olivine are derived from the breakdown of TiCl intergrowths. Thermodynamic modelling of selected Almirez bulk rock compositions indicates a temperature increase from 635 degrees C to 695 degrees C, at pressures ranging from 1.7 GPa to 2.0 GPa, as the cause for the compositional adjustment of TiCl between the Almirez antigorite serpentinite and chlorite harzburgite. These P-T estimates are in good agreement with the sequence of phase relations observed in the field. The computed phase diagrams in conjunction with the geothermal conditions envisaged for different subduction settings indicate that TiCl is stable in the vicinity of the antigorite serpentinite/chlorite harzburgite phase boundary in some subduction settings. In these circumstances, clinohumite-olivine intergrowths in chlorite harzburgite may act as a sink for high field strength elements, and probably other elements, that are present in the mantle-wedge fluids."

We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces.

Neither specimen was recorded in a cave, but now a third specimen has been found in a cave in southern Spain and the presence of this species in Spain is confirmed. Metabelbella phalangioides corn. nov. could be a truly troglobic species because the specimen is rather pale coloured despite having a great body size.

This topographic depression is a plateau with an average elevation of 1000 m in the northern limb of the Sierra Nevada range. The continental deposits infilling the Guadix basin span time from the late Tortonian to the Pleistocene, when a laminar calcrete developed on fine-to coarse-grained fluvial and lacustrine deposits. The drainage pattern is strongly incised (up to 200 m) below the calcrete layer. Four coeval subsamples from the top laminae of the calcrete were collected and dated by the U/Th method. The resulting date is 42.6 +/- 5.6 ka, which indicates the minimum age for the cessation of active sedimentation in the Guadix basin. Using this age, we have calculated the incision and erosion rates for the late Pleistocene to present-day time span in the Arroyo de Gor, a highly incised canyon in the eastern border of the Guadix basin. The minimum incision rates in this canyon are around 4 mm/yr. We envisage the capture of the Pliocene-Pleistocene endorheic Guadix basin by the Guadalquivir River after 42 ka as the main factor triggering the formation of the present-day eroded landscape. After the capture, the combination of climatic (wet periods), lithological (soft and loose sediments), and topographic (high average altitude) features allowed the development of the present-day entrenched drainage pattern."

Moreover, the immediate proximity to certain plants can benefit other plants that grow below them, where toxicity or spines act as a physical barrier or concealment against herbivores. This paper presents the results of a multi-scale experiment performed to test the effect of shrubs as protectors of tree saplings against herbivores and the mechanism involved in Mediterranean ecosystems. We performed a factorial design in two mountain ranges, similar in physiognomy and vegetation, planting saplings of a palatable tree, the maple (Acer opalus subsp. granatense), and an unpalatable tree, the black pine (Pinus nigra), under three different types of shrubs. We considered four experimental microhabitats: highly palatable shrub (Amelanchier ovalis), palatable but spiny shrub (Crataegus monogyna or Prunus ramburii), unpalatable spiny shrub (Berberis vulgaris subsp. australis) and control (gaps of bare soil without shrubs). Three main factors were found to determine the probability of sapling attack: sapling palatability, experimental microhabitat and plot. Palatable saplings (maples) were browsed much more than unpalatable ones (pines). The degree of protection provided by the shrub proved greater as its palatability decreased with respect to sapling palatability, the unpalatable spiny shrub being the safest microhabitat for palatable saplings and bare soil for unpalatable ones. The differences found in number of attacked saplings between plots may be attributable to differences in herbivore pressure. The community context in which interaction takes place, namely the characteristics of the neighbours and the intensity of herbivore pressure, are determining factors for understanding and predicting the damage undergone by a target plant species. The mechanism that best explains these results is associational avoidance of saplings that grow near to unpalatable shrubs. It is necessary to introduce this neighbour effect in theoretical models and food-web approaches that analyse the plant-herbivore relationships, since it can strongly determine not only the intensity of the interaction, but also the spatial distribution and diversity of the plant community."

Although several studies have focused on the effect of exotic fishes on native amphibians breeding in ponds or lakes, little is known about their effects on stream-breeding species. We studied the effects of introductions of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) on the stream-breeding, endemic Iberian frog (Rana iberica) in a protected area in central Spain. We assessed occurrence patterns of tadpoles and salmonids and compared habitat use of the three species. We also determined experimentally whether chemical cues from salmonids elicited antipredator behavior in tadpoles. Finally, we assessed the relative influence of tadpole habitat preferences, differences in salmonid species, and invasion geography on tadpole occurrence. Despite widely overlapping habitat preferences, tadpoles and trout did not coexist, with the former restricted to fishless habitats. Tadpoles detected chemical cues from both trout species and reacted by decreasing their activity, although the response toward the native brown trout was stronger. The residual distribution of Iberian frogs in Penalara is better explained by the geography of fish invasions than by the fish species involved. Measures such as fish extirpation from certain areas, aimed at recovering lost habitat and improving connectivity among remaining populations of Iberian frogs, seem critical for the species' long-term survival in central Spain."

Seedlings emerging early in the growing season often have a greater rate of survival or grow better if early emergence provides advantages with respect to an environmental cue. As a result, the benefits of early emergence may be lost if the environmental stress creating the differences among cohorts disappears. The experimental manipulation under field conditions of the factors that constitute the main sources of stress for seedling establishment is thus a straightforward method to evaluate the impact of date of emergence on seedling establishment under realistic conditions. Methods Two field experiments were performed to analyse the effect of emergence date on survival and first-year growth of Scots pine seedlings in natural mountain forests in south-east Spain. Two main environmental factors that determine seedling success in these mountains were considered: (1) microhabitat type (monitoring the effect of date of emergence in the three most common microhabitats where seedlings recruit); (2) summer drought (monitored by an irrigation treatment with control and watered sampling points). Key Results Overall, early emergence resulted in a higher probability of survival and better growth in the two experiments and across microhabitats. However, the reduction in summer drought did not diminish the differences observed among cohorts: all cohorts increased their survival and growth, but early cohorts still had a clear advantage. Conclusions Date of emergence determines establishment success of Pinus sylvestris seedlings, even if cohorts are separated by only a few days, irrespective of the intensity of summer drought. The experimental design, covering a gradient of light intensity and soil moisture that simulates conditions of the regeneration niche of Scots pine across its geographical range, allows the results to be extrapolated to other areas of the species. Date of emergence is thus likely to have a large impact on the demography of Scots pine across its geographical range."

It is operated and maintained by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA-CSIC) and contains two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5 and 0.9m and an Altazimuth telescope with an aperture of 0.6m. Given that the quality of the images and, indeed, the performance of the instruments are influenced by weather conditions, it would appear that the existence of a weather station capable of producing accurate descriptions is an essential component of any observatory. This is particularly true, however, in our case where, given the altitude, weather conditions at certain times of the year are especially harsh(1). For this reason, our observatory has required the installation of a robust weather station with easily replaceable sensors which can provide accurate and reliable measures of wind, temperature and humidity(2). At the same time, in order to avoid a complex topology of unmanageably long wires due to the distribution of a large number of sensors around the buildings, domes telescope mirrors and instruments, it has been necessary to implement a distributed system with several independent nodes connected to a CAN bus. This system is now in operation and running automatically at the OSN and provides all the data from sensors to the observatory control systems and to internet users. This paper gives a detailed description of the SNOWS project, including the development of the weather station, the software and hardware architecture, and the use of distributed nodes with a linear serial bus. The paper also provides some results regarding the wind, temperature and humidity sensors employed at the OSN."	"PT: S"	NA	"Lewis,H. Bridger,A."

Our study will focus on two Nasmyth telescopes with apertures of 1.5m and 0.9m and an equatorial mount. The system currently installed to control these telescopes is a 1995 centralized VME module. However, given the problems which have arisen due to the number of wires and other complications, we have decided to change this control module. We will control each telescope with a distributed control philosophy, using a serial linear communication bus between independent nodes, although all system capabilities are accessible from a central unit anywhere and at any time via internet. We have divided the tasks and have one node for alpha control, another for delta control, one for the dome, one for the focus and the central unit to interface with a pc. The nodes for alpha, delta and the dome will be used by means of FPGA's in order to efficiently sample the encoders and the control algorithms, and to generate the output for the motors and the servo. The focus will have a microcontroller, and the system is easy to expand in the event of the inclusion of more nodes. After having studied several fieldbus systems, we have opted for the CAN bus, because of its reliability and broadcasting possibilities. In this way, all the important information will be on the bus, and every node will be able to access the information at any time. This document explains the new design made in the IAA for the new consoles of control whose basic characteristics are, the distributed control, the hardware simplify, the cable remove, the safety and maintenance improve and facilitating the observation improving the interface with the user, and finally to prepare the system for the remote observation."

To investigate the possible effect of co-evolutionary pressures on cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles (the presumed nestmate recognition cues), we performed a comparative analysis of the CHC of R. minuchae and P. longiseta colonies from both the allopatric and sympatric populations; the latter includes samples of enslaved as well as free-living workers. Discriminant analyses based on these chemical profiles showed two clear profile groups: the first comprised R. minuchae and both enslaved and free-living P. longiseta from the sympatric population; and the second the allopatric P. longiseta workers. As expected, the profiles of the two sympatric P. longiseta groups (enslaved and free-living) were distinct; but, interestingly, those of the enslaved P. longiseta and its parasite R. minuchae were also distinguishable. This indicates that despite their cohabitation each species maintains its own chemical identity. Profile similarity between the sympatric free-living P. longiseta and its parasite may explain the lower than expected aggression observed during raids. We further speculate that in view of the differences between the sympatric and allopatric population of P. longiseta, co-evolutionary pressures have driven changes in the profile of the former to better match that of its parasite R. minuchae. Such an adjustment may have enabled nests of the sympatric P. longiseta to endure multiple raids by the parasite (due to the reduced aggression) and thus to continue to reproduce despite the damage inflicted by the raids."

The main objectives of this field campaign were the study of the influence of elevation and atmospheric aerosols on measured UV radiation. In the first stage of the field campaign, a common calibration and intercomparison between Licor-1800 spectroradiometers and Cimel-318 Sun photometers was performed in order to assess the quality of the measurements from the whole campaign. The intercomparison of the Licor spectroradiometers showed, for both direct and global irradiances, that when the comparisons were restricted to the visible part of the spectrum the deviations were within the instruments' nominal accuracies which allows us to rely on these instruments for measuring physical properties of aerosols at the different measurement stations. A simultaneous calibration on AOD data was performed for the Cimel-318 Sun photometers. When a common calibration and methodology was applied, the deviation was lowered to much less than 0.01 for AOD. At the same time an intercomparison has been made between the AOD values given by the spectroradiometers and the Sun photometers, with deviations obtained from 0.01 to 0.03 for the AOD in the visible range, depending on the channel. In the UVA range, the AOD uncertainty was estimated to be around 0.02 and 0.05 for Cimel and Licor respectively. In general the experimental differences were in agreement with this uncertainty estimation. In the UVB range the AOD measurements should not be used due to maximum instrumental uncertainties."

Picual) trees under three different types of soil management: (1) non-tillage with barley (Hordeum vulgare) strips of 4 m width (BS); (2) conventional tillage (CT); (3) non-tillage without plant strips (NT). The erosion plots, located in Lanjaron (Alpujarras) on the southern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in south-eastern Spain, had 30% slope at an altitude of 565 m and 192 m(2) (24x8 m) in area. The highest erosion and runoff values, ranging from 10.5 to 40.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and from 26.5 to 51.5 mm yr(-1), respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under NT. In CT, erosion ranged from 1.0 to 10.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 6.7 to 15.2 mm yr(-1), while under BS, erosion ranged from 1.7 to 2.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and runoff from 19.6 to 20.0 mm yr(-1). It is concluded that the BS and CT reduced the soil erosion by 92% and 78%, with respect to the NT, and the runoff by 49% and 72%, respectively. The total NPK losses (sediments and runoff) from BS averaged 0.87, 0.07 and 0.72 kg ha(-1), from CT 1.82, 0.11 and 0.97 kg ha(-1) and from NT 3.15, 0.29 and 2.45 kg ha(-1), respectively. In addition, nutrient concentrations in the surface runoff were higher than the recommended level for standard water quality for N-NO(3), N-NH(4) and soluble P, particularly from NT and CT. These results support the recommendation of non-tillage with barley strips for sloped agricultural land in order to reduce erosion and pollution."

The following species are recognized for the Spanish bryological flora: W. exannulata (Schimp.) Loeske, W. fluitans (Hedw.) Loeske and W. sarmentosa (Wahlenb.) Hedenas. W. exannulata is confirmed in Portugal and Andorra and W. fluitans is excluded from the checklist for Portugal and Balearic Islands. All specimens determined in Iberian herbaria as Drepanocladus aduncus var. asturicus (Renauld) Riehm., D. exannulatus subfo. falcifolius Moenk., D. exannulatus var. alpinus (Grav.) Wijk & Margad. and D. fluitans var. falcatus (C.E.O. Jensen) G. Roth, have been re-identified as Warnstorfia exannulata. Warnstorfia exannulata is common in the mountainous areas of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Regions of the northern and central part of the Iberian Peninsula, in three distinct areas: Pyrenees, Iberian-Atlantic Ranges (Galician-Portuguese Massif, Cantabrian Range, and Central Range), and Sierra Nevada (south Spain), although it is very rare in the latter. W. fluitans and W. sarmentosa are rare as both have higher moisture requirements than W. exannulata. Their distribution is limited to the mountains of the Eurosiberian Region of Spain, from the Cantabrian Range to the Pyrenees, where there is a strong Atlantic influence. The threats to Warnstorfia populations in the Iberian Peninsula are analyzed."

In Kernera saxatilis, Silene rupestris and Gentiana alpina we found intraspecific phylogroups corresponding to mountain regions as predicted by the vicariance hypothesis. Moreover, genetic distances between Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees populations were always higher than those between populations from the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. This suggests successive disruption of gene exchange between mountain ranges as postglacial climatic warming proceeded from south to north. In Papaver alpinum, our data indicate that a central Pyrenean population arose via long-distance dispersal from the Sierra Nevada, and that vicariant separation events between the Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees and between the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps occurred simultaneously. Overall, Sierra Nevada populations of all species investigated here preserve unexpectedly high (or not exceptionally reduced) genetic diversity. This testifies to the important influence of long-term isolation, i.e. vicariance, on genetic diversity through fostering the accumulation of new mutations and/or the fixation of ancestral ones."

This study uses RAPD data, as a total DNA marker, and morphometrics, as potentially revealing hybridization and introgression, to throw further light on the origin of the above mentioned contact zone. Individuals of the two taxa sampled from the range do not show a F1 hybrid profile for RAPD or for morphometrics. To integrate these results with the previously published sequence data (ITS and chloroplast spacer trnL-F) it is proposed that introgressive hybridization has occurred in A. villosa subsp. bernisii, whereas for A. filicaulis the contact zone occurs at the intraspecific level. With the available data, the contact between individuals of Armeria with different genotypes in the two taxa may have implied westward migration from a biodiverse massif like Sierra Nevada, and this may apply to other organisms although further data are needed to confirm it."

Faults of the Alpujarras fault zone define a regional-scale complex ENE-striking transfer zone that marks the boundary among the Sierra Nevada elongated dome, a highly-extended, constricted core-complex, and a less-extended domain formed by large-scale tilt-blocks. Detailed mapping and structural analysis show that the Alpujarras fault zone is an integral part of the WSW-directed normal fault systems that thinned the Betic hinterland during the middle Miocene to Recent time. Fault patterns and palaeostress analysis both indicate that dextral movement along the strike-slip faults was induced by a local stress field with a sub-horizontal E-W- to ESE-WNW-trending maximum principal stress axis, which is synchronous with the regional stress field driving the normal fault systems. Palaeostress analysis also indicates subsequent variations in the stress field with a sub-horizontal NW-SE- to N-S-trending maximum principal stress axis, thus producing both the tectonic inversion of the northern fault of the Alpujarras system and shortening of the unloaded extensional detachment footwall. A simplified kinematic model for the tectonic evolution of the Alpujarras area from the middle Miocene to Recent emphasizes the kinematic coupling of normal faults and strike-slip transfer zones in the extensional process.

The effect of climate variability on phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics and nutrient availability was studied in two high mountain fishless lakes (La Caldera and Rio Seco) of contrasting morphology, hydrology and dissolved inorganic nitrogen : soluble reactive phosphate (DIN : SRP) ratios during 1986 and after a 10-year-long drought in 1996 and 1997. 2. Thaw was delayed and water temperatures were lower in both lakes in 1996 than in 1986 and 1997. However, the lake-specific DIN : SRP ratio was maintained in the 3 years studied, reflecting its local control. 3. On other hand, the presumptive limiting nutrient in each lake, P in La Caldera and N in Rio Seco, showed higher concentrations in 1996 versus 1986 and 1997. Significant positive correlations between temperature and chlorophyll a were found in both lakes in 1996 but these relationships were negative or not significant in 1986 and 1997. Zooplankton biomass showed lower values in 1996 than in 1986 or 1997. 4. These findings can be explained by a decoupling of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction because of a constraint on zooplankton growth by low temperatures in the coldest year studied.

"In order to assess the availability of areas for reintroducing the Bearded Vulture in Andalusia, Southern Spain, potential breeding sites were modelled. The GLM model selected four variables: altitude, topographic irregularity, distance to village and distance to the nearest neighbouring breeding pair. A GIS was used to obtain digital models for each variable. We validated the GLM model testing it with new nest sites in a different geographical context, without including distance to neighbouring pairs. According to the model, in Andalusia the areas with probability > 0.8 coincided with the main mountain ranges. Of these, we selected only protected areas within the historical range of the species. Thus, eight protected areas were considered and surveyed to evaluate their feasibility for reintroduction. We gathered information at two geographical scales:1-km and 15-km radius around high-probability cliffs. We summarised environmental information on habitat quality and threat level in a matrix that made it possible to compare the viability of reintroduction in each of these eight areas. Poisoning cases and the density of power lines were the most restrictive variables. Sierra Nevada National Park, which was expected to be one of the best areas, showed a high level of threat because of power lines, cable cars and outdoor activities.

In the Granada basin, according to the interpretation of the seismic profiles and results of the backstripping analysis, subsidence and sedimentation rates were at a maximum in the late Tortonian and decreased progressively; meanwhile, the neighbouring areas were uplifted forming important relief. Chronostratigraphical revisions of the marine sediments show that the marine incursion that deposited sediments in the Granada basin lasted only 1.3 Ma, between 8.5 and 7.2 Ma. The gradual retreat of the sea in the Granada basin is not attributable to global eustatic fluctuations, but rather to uplift in the Sierra Nevada and its adjacent areas. From latest Tortonian to early Messinian times, the region became continental and the Granada basin acquired its present physiography and was differentiated as such. From the late Tortonian onwards, NNW-SSE compression combined with ENE-WSW extension affected the cordillera. In the Granada basin, extension controlled fault movements. There are two well-defined fault sets: the first trends 70 degrees N-90 degrees E, with low angle faults (less than 30 degrees) dipping towards the north and south, defining the subsiding areas which have approximately E-W direction; whereas the second set has a NW-SE direction, and cuts and displaces the previous ones, defining the main subsiding areas in the eastern part of the basin. The reinterpretation of seismic profiles reveals that the subsiding axes within the Granada basin persisted from the Tortonian to the present because of continued displacements of the main faults."

Particularly, evolution towards complex social systems in ants affects how individuals move in space, usually by making females philopatric. Proformica longisetais well-suited for studying the effects of female philopatry, because female sexuals are wingless and do not actively disperse. We studied genetic population structure in P. longiseta in local scale both as genetic viscosity within one subpopulation, and as differentiation between closely (0.1-1.5 km) located subpopulations, by using nuclear (microsatellites) and mitochondrial (SSCP) markers. Dependent colony founding by splitting old nests is the only known nest founding strategy in P. longiseta. However, no genetic viscosity was detected at the nuclear markers within the subpopulation studied, possibly due to the dynamic nature of P. longiseta populations. The extreme female philopatry showed as strong structure between closely located subpopulations in the mitochondrial genome, but there was no isolation by distance showing that the differentiation pattern was random. Genetic structure in the nuclear genome was much weaker, and there was an indication of isolation by distance. This suggests that male dispersal is strong but not totally free across the area. Finally, non-dispersing P. longiseta females necessarily mate locally raising the possibility of inbreeding, but inbreeding coefficients showed that mating is random."

At local scales, topography is the most important factor in determining the distribution of solar radiation at the surface. Interpolation techniques are usually employed to estimate solar radiation where stations are not available, but their usefulness is limited where topography is an important source of variability. The use of satellite data and more recently of models based on techniques GIS, have contributed to solve this difficulty. In this work the usefulness of a digital elevation model (DEM) in providing topographic information for the estimation of solar radiation in areas of complex topography is analysed. Daily global radiation values were generated using the Solar Analyst software, which uses topographic information to generate radiation data. The generated data were compared with the experimental data obtained from 14 radiometric stations located within the Sierra Nevada Natural Park (southern Spain), an area of complex topography. Results show the usefulness of the topographic information derived from a DEM to estimate the solar radiation in areas Of complex topography. Nevertheless, results depend on the DEM resolution and it is important that other factors, such as the albedo, should also be taken into account to obtain better estimates."

The lowest runoff and soil erosion rates, ranging from 9 to 26 mm yr(-1) and from 0.01 to 0.31 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under the Thymus serpylloides.

The species is present in 19% of the study region, and in areas not cited so far in the literature. A detailed analysis of habitat suitability was also carried out, applying a new methodology, Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis, which uses presence data to build a habitat suitability map of a given species. As livestock activity is quite intense in the region, the presence of a potential competitor, the domestic goat (Capra hircus), was included in the analyses. Factors affecting ibex relative abundance were determined by means of a nested stepwise multiple regression, where livestock presence/absence was the nested factor. The presence of livestock has a negative effect on ibex relative abundance, causing the ibex to select areas of poor, sparse vegetation, cultivated lands and forests, whereas in the absence of livestock, the ibex is mainly present in pasture-scrub lands and non-cultivated lands. Conservation implications of these results are discussed in the context of a Mediterranean region where extensive livestock grazing systems abound."

One particularly problematic example is that of wild ungulates which are increasingly being established in regions outside their natural distribution range due to human hunting interests. Unfortunately, we know little of the effects these large herbivores may have on the host ecosystems. This study deals with a first comparative analysis of the habitat requirements of two ungulate species that may be facing competition for resources in the south of Europe: the native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) and the exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). The aoudad is a North African caprid introduced in 1970 as a game species in south-eastern Spain. It has adapted well, and populations have been freely expanding since then. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis is used to describe the realized niche of both species where their distribution ranges merge. Both species occupy marginal areas of rugged terrain in the region. Marginality is higher for the Iberian ibex, which also presents a higher tolerance of secondary environmental gradients than the aoudad. Highly suitable areas for each species are secondarily suitable for the other. Reclassified and cross-tabulated habitat suitability maps showing the areas of potential spatial coexistence and differences in ecological traits between both species are provided. The results obtained do not allow inferring resource competition between these species. However, current aoudad expansion could result in it invading the favoured habitats of the ibex. Inadequate hunting policy and monitoring, and increasing climatic resemblance of the study region to the native aoudad areas, due to a strong desertification process, are facilitating a high rate of expansion. We strongly recommend to eradicate or, at least, monitor these exotic populations, and promote active conservation practices, if one wants to preserve the unique natural resources present in this European region."

Here we present the characterization of Msat-160 from Chionomys nivalis, a species with a very primitive karyotype. As in other Microtus species analyzed, C. nivalis Msat-160 is AT rich, has a monomer length of 160 bp, is undermethylated and is mainly located in all the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome, but is completely absent from the Y chromosome. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that Msat-160 was initially distributed in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all autosomes and the X chromosome. The taxonomic status of the genus Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus is a very interesting issue, so we constructed phylogenetic dendrograms using Msat-160 sequences from several Microtus species. Although the results were not informative about this issue, the presence of Msat-160 in C. nivalis and Microtus species suggested that both genera are closely related and that this satellite DNA was present in the common ancestor. Studies of Msat-160 in different arvicoline species could help to determine the origin of this satellite and, perhaps, to establish the phylogenetic relationships of some arvicoline groups."

From July to the end of September two Cimel CE-318 radiometers have been operated continuously, one at Andalusian Centre for Environmental Studies (CEAMA), located in the urban area of Granada, a non-industrialized medium size city (37.16 degrees N, 3.61 degrees W and 680 m a.m.s.l.), and the second one at the Astronomical Observatory of Sierra Nevada (37.06 degrees N, 3.38 degrees W and 2896 m a.m.s.l.), with a short horizontal separation between stations that allows us to consider both instrument located in approximately the same vertical column. The Cimel CE-318 measurements have been used to retrieve the aerosol columnar properties, including the columnar volume size distribution, volume scattering phase function, asymmetry factor and single scattering albedo, by means of appropriate inversion procedures. Additionally, at the CEAMA a Raman Lidar system based on a Nd:YAG laser source operating at 1064, 532 y 355 nm and including elastic, polarized and Raman shifted detection has been used to derive profiles of several atmospheric aerosol properties. In this paper we present analyses of the changes and temporal evolution detected in atmospheric aerosol vertical profile.

In Sonora, the environments with chaetetids were quiet, and located below wave base. Shallower facies with staffellids and Komia generally top the chaetetids. Because of the associated micritic deposits, the chaetetids have inhabited probably a soft or firm substrate. As a result of the disphotic-aphotic reconstructed environments, the possible symbionts of the chaetetids are more probably heterotrophic bacteria than autotrophic algae. The most comparable ecological conditions exist in the Atokan Marble Falls Formation of central Texas (USA).

The aim of this work is to establish the effect of the parent material, climate conditions and vegetation type on the evolution of the soil organic matter in different Mediterranean environments as an essential step for assessing soil stability and indirectly the fragility of these ecosystems that are prone to erosion. Thirty-six soil samples of organic-mineral horizon were taken in unreclaimed soils from areas of great ecological value in South-East Spain with calcareous (Sierra de Cazorla-Segura-Las Villas Natural Park), acid metamorphic (Sierra Nevada National Park) and calcareous and volcanic substrata (Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park), and beneath three vegetation types (natural forests, reforested forests and scrublands). Characterization of the soil organic fraction by IR spectroscopy showed relatively uniform results probably caused by similar climatic and Mediterranean environmental conditions. Nonetheless, humic substances in the surface horizons were better developed in the calcareous/volcanic area than the calcareous and acid metamorphic areas, with the latter showing the greatest differences. The acid environment soils of Sierra Nevada can be characterized as the least favourable for efficient humus development, with it then being more fragile in terms of conservation. The results also indicate some differences due to the type of vegetation on soil humus chemistry, with a more negative effect beneath reforested forests of Pinus in an edaphic acid environment. In general, it may be stated that the organic matter beneath scrubland and natural forests of Quercus are more decomposed than beneath Pinus and the humus is more evolved."

Microstructure showed a dramatic reduction in organic cements and fungal hyphae. The organic content of soil seeded with grass significantly improved compared with soil not seeded or seeded unsuccessfully (P < 0.05), especially where the topsoil was reinstated. Organic C content, microporosity and soil respiration increased by 200% (+21 +/- 5 t ha(-1)), 70% (+0.07 +/- 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)) and 140% (+0.10 +/- 0.04 mg CO2 g(-1) day(-1)), respectively. Average micropore size in aggregates which in undisturbed soils was 3.40 +/- 0.28 mu m reverted to 3.52 +/- 0.36 mu m. However, the microstructure of the revegetated soils did not attain the levels of organic cements and fungal hyphae in the natural soils. Dolomite and salts were added to the soil to aid slope stabilization, fertility and de-icing of access tracks. As a consequence, there were increases in pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate equivalent and base saturation.

The evolution of this complex can help to determine both when the lower HP/LT complexes began to exhume and the behavior of the upper plate during this process. Moreover, this complex is a key element to understanding the relationships between the late orogenic extension in the internal Betic Cordillera and the coeval compression in the External Zones of the same mountain chain. This paper focuses in the geometry and kinematics of the Alpine structures of this Malaguide Complex in the eastern Betic Cordillera, near the village of Velez Rubio. We propose that these Alpine structures can be grouped into three main stages. First stage (Paleogene) began with a synmetamorphic slaty cleavage produced in anchizone conditions. This foliation is associated with northward vergent structures and was probably connected with the superposition of the Malaguide Complex over the Alpujarride during the middle Eocene. This first stage ended with the thinning of the Malaguide Complex (Oligocene) by an extensional detachment with a top-to-the-NNW sense of movement. Second stage records the convergence of the External and Internal Zones during the Aquitanian-Burdigalian. This convergence was a right-lateral transpression that produced back thrusts and extensional structures that exhumed the HP/LT rocks of the Alpujarride Complex. Third stage corresponds to the evolution from the late Burdigalian to the present-day, when the Internal and External zones were welded together."

Here, we provide evidence of the functional role of pollination diversity in a plant species, Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). Pollinator abundance, richness and diversity as well as plant reproduction and recruitment were determined in eight plant populations. We found that E. mediohispanicum was generalized both at the regional and local (population) scale, since its flowers were visited by more than 100 species of insects with very different morphology, size and behaviour. However, populations differed in the degree of generalization. Generalization correlated with pollinator abundance and plant population size, but not with habitat, ungulate damage intensity, altitude or spatial location. More importantly, the degree of generalization had significant consequences for plant reproduction and recruitment. Plants from populations with intermediate generalization produced more seeds than plants from populations with low or high degrees of generalization. These differences were not the result of differences in number of flowers produced per plant. In addition, seedling emergence in a common garden was highest in plants from populations with intermediate degree of generalization. This outcome suggests the existence of an optimal level of generalizations even for generalized plant species."

Although most researchers agree that processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales affect ecological communities, empirical support is still scarce. In this paper, we seek to discern whether the relationship between abundance, biomass, and species diversity, on the one hand, and habitat heterogeneity, on the other, holds across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, we analyse whether the pattern/variation found depends on the taxonomic level, and the diversity index used. To answer these questions, we sampled arthropod assemblages across three nested temporal and spatial scales. In general, we found variability in the responses to habitat heterogeneity across scales according to the assemblage descriptor, the taxonomic level selected, and the diversity index used. Our results suggest that generalization is difficult and extrapolation should be made with caution. Moreover, the use of more than one diversity index would provide additional and complementary information about species-distribution patterns and the mechanisms generating these patterns."

For this, we analysed 82 threatened taxa and 17 mountain areas using correspondence analysis (CA) and complementarity analysis. Of the 2,197.5 km(2) of high-mountain areas analysed, only 1,654.5 km(2) are currently protected (75.3%). Of the 82 threatened species, 16 have no type of protection, eight are critically endangered and six are endangered (according to the categories of the UICN): Overgrazing and natural causes are the main factors threatening most of the species. The Sierra Nevada mountain (Granada and Almeria provinces) and Cazorla-Segura mountain Jaen province) provide protection for 67.5% of the total number of threatened orophilous species, and 71.7% of the species evaluated as critically endangered.

The main objectives of the work are: 1) Identification of the whole set of plant communities described in the study area. 2) Analysis of the phytogeographical relationships between the summit areas. 3) Characterize a sere of ecological and management variables for each syntaxon that led us establish the main \"conservation-value\" groups, and the weight of each variable. 4) Calculation of values such as richness, continuous or discontinuous rarity, and complementarity. 5) Establish conclusions relevant to conservation purposes at community level in these areas. For this, 17 mountain areas have been selected, occupying a surface area of 2197.5 km(2) and represented by 65 syntaxa. For each area, information has been compiled to construct two data matrices, which have been analysed with multivariate techniques of classification (cluster analysis) and ordination (correspondence analysis) as well as non-linear methods (categorical principal-component analysis; CATPCA). The priority areas for conservation have been determined by applying the concepts of richness, continuous rarity, discontinuous rarity and complementarity. In the 17 mountain areas, a series of aspects related to community ecology were analysed, such as types of habitats represented, distribution, thermotypes, ombroytpes and substrate, in addition to others related to diversity and conservation, including type of rarity, richness in endemic and/or endangered species, protection level, conservation status, and threat factors. The data analysis of presence/ absence in the different massifs resulted in 4 groups: the first composed of Teleda-Almijara, calcareous Sierra Nevada, and Gador; the second of Grazalema, las Nieves, Loja, Lujar, Estancias, and Huetor-Harana; the third of Baza, Maria-Orce, Cazorla, the Subbetic, Magina, and la Sagra; the fourth of Filabres and siliceous Sierra Nevada. The CATPCA quite clearly separated the groups with well-differentiated conservation needs on the basis of their ecology and degree conservation (this being a combination of different factors). Finally, the work concludes by discussing the results and making a series of recommendations for conservation at community level."

In this context, performed germination experiments were performed with a set of 37 endemic, rare or often endangered, taxa of the Sierra Nevada high mountain (SE Spain), an area that constitutes a hotspot of diversity in the Mediterranean region. Seed germination varied depending on the species, from 0% to ca. 95%. A group of 10 species belonging to 9 families showed a low or null germination percentage. Dormancy in these species is likely to be complex and to involve some kind of physiological ground. A second group of species showed a germination percentage between 5 and 20%, most of these belonging to families producing hard-coated seeds (e.g. Papillionaceae, Geraniaceae). Treatments to promote their germination were thus easy to apply. A large fraction of taxa had a germination percentage above 20%, often above 50%. The germination percentage did not correlate positively with the speed of germination (estimated as the T-50) or with altitude, but correlated negatively (although weakly) with diaspore mass. Families such as Compositae, Cruciferae, Geraniaceae, Labiatae and Papillionaceae are identified as families where seed germination may not imply major problems. Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. nevadensis, Arenaria nevadensis, Carex camposii, Gentiana lutea, Linaria glacialis, Narcissus nevadensis, Nardus stricta, Odontites granatensis, Papaver lapeyrousianum and Sorbus hybrida need studies of dormancy breakage to establish guidelines to optimize management of the scant seed material.

We compared seismic and soil penetration measurements of combined A + C and Cr horizon thickness, soil moisture and temperature, and stand variables in a contiguous 4-ha mixed-conifer stand of the Sierra Nevada. Thickness of A + C and Cr horizons were highly variable but were not correlated to each other. Total basal area and canopy cover were positively related with A + C horizon thickness, and shrub cover was positively related with Cr horizon thickness. Basal area of white fir [Abies concolor (Gord and Glend) Lindl.] and incense-cedar [Calocedrus decurrens (Torrey) Florin] were positively correlated with A + C horizon thickness, but there was no relationship between A + C or Cr horizon thickness and basal area of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. and Balf.), sugar pine (P. lambertiana Douglas), or red fir (A. magnifica A. Murray). Both white and red fir seedlings were associated with decreased soil temperature, but only white fir seedlings were positively associated with soil moisture. Soil penetration estimates of soil thickness were similar to seismic estimates for shallow soils (< 50 cm depth) but were poorly related on deeper soils. Visual surface conditions and tile probe estimates of soil thickness can be highly misleading because 'shallow' areas may have a thick layer of weathered bedrock that can serve as a potential rooting medium for deep-rooted trees and shrubs. In our study only the refraction seismic method had the potential to measure total soil depth that included A + C and Cr horizon thickness."

The present work examines the way in which dipper (Cinclus cinclus) morphology has varied over the past 20 years (1985-2005) in Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). Tarsus length has decreased, but wing and tail length have increased in the same period. These opposite trends have provoked changes in the allometric relationships among the different parts of the body in the dipper. A decrease in body size is predicted by Bergmann's rule, and similar results have been found in other birds. However, although this study found a decrease in tarsus length, no change was found for body mass. The increase in wing and tail length may be related to a variation in the trophic niche in response to the decrease in water volume of rivers that occurred during the study period. Other studies show that the dipper's diet varies with water flow, and water flow has decreased in the study area as a consequence of climatic warming."

A rapid method for measuring K fixation could help clarify relationships with other soil properties, especially mineralogy. Our objectives were to compare some existing measurement techniques for soil K fixation and availability, develop an alternative K fixation test, and evaluate the utility of soil texture and parent material for predicting K fixation in soils derived from granitic Sierra Nevada (SN) and nongranitic Coast Range (CR) alluvium. Potassium pools were estimated by 1 mol L-1 NH4OAc and sodium tetraphenylboron (TPB) extractions. Our 1-h fixation method correlated well (R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.001) with a 7-d procedure, so the 1-h method was used for subsequent work. The SN soils fixed up to 740 mg K kg(-1); CR soils fixed up to 263 mg K kg-1. There was no significant relationship between K fixation and soil clay or silt content for either parent material. The TPB test had a stronger correlation with NH4OAc-extractable K in SN soils (R-2 = 0.77, P= 0.001) than in CR (R-2 = 0.49, P= 0.001). Plant-available nonexchangeable K (PANK = TPB minus NH4OAc) did not correlate with K fixation potential for pooled data from all pedons (R-2 < 0.11), and had negative correlation (R-2 from 0.97 to 0.99, P = 0.01) for individual pedons. The PANK probably represents K that has already been fixed and satisfies some of the K fixation capacity. The 1-h test is a reliable, rapid method for predicting K fixation potential. Together, the TPB and NH4OAc tests could be useful for identifying K already fixed by soils, thereby reducing K fixation potential."

"The snow vole is a glacial relic that currently has a highly fragmented distribution spread throughout the south-western paleartic region. It is found in rocky habitats, such as scree, usually at the top of the main mountain ranges. There are five main population nuclei in the Iberian Peninsula. These populations are located in: the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian, Iberian and Central Systems, and the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. The Sierra Nevada National and Natural Parks represent the most south-western limit of its distribution area; however, this population has not been well studied. This study provides an update on the historically known distribution of the snow vole in the Sierra Nevada National and Natural Parks. The study area was subdivided into 10x10 km UTM grids. Stratified sampling was conducted focusing on potential patches of habitats for the snow vole. Both direct and indirect sampling methods were applied. A total of 100 potential localities were sampled in the study area verifying the presence of snow voles in 75% of them. This study examines the presence of the snow vole in its former known distribution areas in the park, maps and details new locations within these areas, and extends the distribution range in the Sierra Nevada due to the discovery of its presence in six new grids."

Daphnia appears to colonize this lake every spring by hatching from ephippia and reproduce by means of subitaneous (non-diapausing) and ephippial (diapausing) eggs. D. pulicaria in this lake is an obligate parthenogenetic population. There is a short time period for subitaneous egg production and a much longer period for ephippial egg production. The contribution of subitaneous eggs to Daphnia population density and structure appears to be low. Diapause onset showed a high temporal synchronization in the three studied years in Rio Seco Lake, and day-length emerged as the main cue triggering diapause onset and the main explanatory factor for the proportion of ephippial females observed. The development and reproduction of D. pulicaria in Rio Seco Lake involves taking a gamble on resting forms to guarantee inter-annual Daphnia persistence in the lake, giving priority to investment in future generations."

In the 27 km 2 Ri o Torrente catchment, Sierra Nevada, southern Spain, rapid base- level fall has triggered knickpoint migration up both trunk and tributary channels, resulting in two distinct geomorphic zones: ( 1) a steep lower catchment with concordant rates of hillslope erosion and channel incision over both short ( 100 years: 5 - 8 mm yr(-1)) and medium ( 12 ka: 5 +/- 1 mm yr(-1)) timescales and ( 2) a low- relief soil- mantled upland topography with uniformly low bedrock and hillslope erosion rates ( 0.05 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1)). The uniformity of erosion in this upland surface indicates that catchment topography was previously in steady state. Rapid river incision below the channel knickpoints has resulted in the development of steep landslide-dominated hillslopes that are essentially \" tracking'' the incising channel. The magnitude of base- level fall required to generate these steep hillslopes is > 100 m; at least 50 m of this base- level fall occurred during the past similar to 21 ka. These steep hillslopes are eroding back into the low- angled upland surface at a much slower rate than the channel knickpoint. Consequently, the trunk channel knickpoint has already reached the catchment headwaters while hillslopes continue to adjust to the new base level, indicating that the channel profile will regain equilibrium form long before hillslopes. Thus hillslopes are the limiting factor for the duration of landscape transience in this small mountain catchment."

Major contrasts in the denudation history are recorded within the 27 km(2) Rio Torrente catchment. Upland areas are characterized by low-relief, low slope angles, and locally the preservation of shallow marine sediments, which have experienced 2 km of denudation since circa 4 Ma. The minimum denudation rates of 0.4 mm yr(-1) derived from AFT also contrast with the slow medium-term (10(4) years) erosion rates (0.044 +/- 0.015 mm yr(-1)) estimated from (10)Be measurements at high elevations. The local medium-long-term contrasts in denudation rates within the high Sierra Nevada indicate that much of the unroofing occurs by tectonic denudation on flat-lying detachments. In lower elevation parts of the catchment, rapid river incision coupled to rock uplift has produced similar to 1.6 km of relief, implying that the rivers and adjacent hillslopes close to the edge of the orogen are sensitive to normal-fault-driven changes in base level. However, these changes are not transmitted into the low-relief slowly eroding upland areas. Thus the core of the mountain range continues to increase in elevation until the limits of crustal strength are reached and denudation is initiated along planes of structural weakness. We propose that this form of tectonic denudation provides an effective limit to relief in young orogens."

We use simple modelling to quantify the effect of particle spalling and/or landsliding on erosion rates determined using a cosmogenic in-situ produced isotope. Analytical results show that the cosmogenic nuclide concentration of a surface experiencing regular detachment of a grain or block may be considered to be in steady state, and 'in-situ' erosion rates estimated, when an appropriate number of spatially independent samples are amalgamated. We present equations that enable calculation of the number of bedrock samples that must be amalgamated for the estimation of mean erosion rates on an outcrop experiencing regular detachment of a grain or chip of thickness L every T years. Our findings confirm that mean catchment erosion rates may be reliably estimated from \"Be concentrations in fluvial sediment in high-relief rapidly eroding terrain. These catchment-wide integrated erosion rates can be calculated where erosion is primarily accomplished through shallow ( 3 m) landslides are the dominant mode of erosion only minimum erosion rates can be determined.

La Caldera is used here as a prototypical example of small high-mountain lakes. Our results demonstrate that transport and mixing in small high-mountain lakes are shaped by the severe changes exhibited at diurnal time scales by the heat fluxes through the air-water interface, strong winds of episodic nature (storms), and the limited horizontal and vertical length scale of the basin. The thermal structure during the cooling phase of the ice-free period undergoes episodic changes that occur at short-time scales, driven by the strong winds with speeds of 15 m s(-1) and higher. During those storms, horizontal and vertical mixing and transport is predominantly driven by wind. During inter-storm periods, the oscillatory nature of the air-water heat exchange at diurnal time scales drives convective circulation, which for a small lake occurs at the basin scale and becomes the dominant mechanism of horizontal transport."

The results of our analysis indicate that cryoclastic and thermoclastic processes, along with chemical weathering, are the main factors controlling rock degradation. Microscale features observed in primary minerals and parent rock fabrics, such as structural discontinuities, cleavage planes, fracturing patterns, and variations in chemical composition, play important roles in triggering weathering and, given sufficient time, progressively lead to grussification and soil development. Exfoliation, hydration, and splitting apart of biotite, as well as hydrolysis and etching of plagioclase and K-feldspar, appear to be prominent factors in the breakdown of bedrock. Whereas time controls the degree of development of the main weathering features and climate influences type and intensity of the dominant processes, relief strongly influences the development and preservation/removal of the regolith/soil cover. Geomorphological evidence of severe surface erosion is quite good, especially along steep slopes where weathering products are quickly removed, although on the highest, dissected paleosurfaces (the oldest paleolandscape remnants in the Sila Massif), wide boulder fields represent relics of past, deep spheroidal weathering that have been exhumed by intense erosion. Erosive, depositional, or reworking phenomena, often enhanced by human activity, are well recorded by macro- and micromorphological features of soils, which show simple, poorly differentiated, rejuvenated profiles, buried or truncated horizons, abundant coarse-grained primary minerals or rock fragments, and pedorelicts. The soil clay mineralogy, characterized by illite, chlorite, and vermiculite, and the dominance of coarse textures confirm a young pedogenetic stage of evolution, although highly weathered sand grains (quartz included) occur in rarely preserved mature paleosols. This interpretation is also consistent with the compositional immaturity of fluvial sands, which have undergone low to moderate transport."

Sierra Nevada (S Spain) is a unique mountain massif within the high-mountain systems of the Mediterranean. It is of great floristic importance and very rich In endemic species. However, it. requires numerous tasks for restoring plant cover due to the constant anthropic degradation, especially because of the ski station located near the second-highest peak of the mountain. One of the restoration efforts consists of trying to reproduce, in the laboratory, the ideal conditions to pre-germinate seeds of some of the species most threatened by these perturbations. This is to transplant the seedlings afterwards in the mountain, thereby contributing to the recovery of these species. With this purpose, a germination experiment was performed, under controlled conditions, with seeds of Genista versicolor Boiss. Hormathophylla spinosa (L.) P. Kupfer, Reseda complicata Bory, and Thymus serpylloides Bory. These four species, native to the Mediterranean high mountains, were germinated under constant darkness, 12 or 24 h light followed by constant darkness, and constant light, at temperatures of 1.5 degrees C or 25 degrees C. The germination process was monitored during 15 days. Results were species-dependent: some species germinated easier under darkness at low temperatures, such as Genista versicolor, whereas Thymus serpylloides presented maximum germination under constant light to a higher temperature."

"In this paper we revise the current records of Formicidae of Sierra Nevada, and include the changes carried out in the taxonomy of the family as well as indicate the possible misidentifications of species in previous records cited in the literature. With these modifications and new contributions, the number of species in Sierra Nevada is raised to 87, three of them, Tapinoma simrothi, Lasius emarginatus and Formica sanguinea remaining still as uncertain records. Out of the total number of species, 22 represent new records from this massif and one of them, Lasius emarginatus, is also a new record for Andalusia. A comparison with previous papers studying the ant fauna of similar massifs, as Sierra de Guadarrama and Sierra de Cazorla, as well as the total number of known species of Andalusia and peninsular Spain, shows that the Sierra Nevada massif is one of the richest of Andalusia. It comprise almost one third of the total number of species of peninsular Spain and 15 species less than Sierra de Guadarrama. However, the number of endemics in Sierra Nevada is very low, only one species being an endemic, probably due to the fact that the cacuminal region (over 2.800 m) in this massif is practically lacking ants, whereas this region usually shows the highest rates of endemic species in mountain regions."

From May to September 2006, rodents were live-trapped, examined for ectoparasites, and blood was collected. All rodents were serologically tested for antibodies to Y. pestis, R. rickettsii, and A. phagocytophilum; in addition, blood samples and ectoparasites were tested by PCR to detect the presence of these zoonotic agents. Overall, 89 rodents, 46 fleas, and four ticks were collected. Antibody prevalence rates observed for rodents were 14% for R. rickettsii or antigenically related spotted-fever group rickettsiae, and 8% for A. phagocytophilum. No samples were positive for antibodies to Y. pestis. Positive PCR results included one yellow-pine chipmunk for Y. pestis (C-T = 32.8), one golden-mantled ground squirrel for R. rickettsii (C-T = 33), and one flea found to be co-infected with both R. rickettsii (C-T = 17) and A. phagocytophilum (C-T = 36).

During the campaign, CIMEL CE-318 robotic radiometer has been one of the key instruments in the characterization of the atmospheric aerosol columnar properties. This kind of radiometers have been operated at Motril, a coastal location at sea level, Pitres (1200 m a.s.l.), located in the South slope of Sierra Nevada Massif, Las Sabinas (2200m a.s.l.), located on the north slope of the mountain range, and Armilla (680m a.s.l.), located in the valley. The principal feature of the locations is that they provide a strong altitudinal gradient. This work presents the evolution of changes followed by the atmospheric aerosol in the vertical column. Columnar aerosol properties have been derived from the CIMEL CE-318 measurements obtained at the four stations. In this sense, the combination of solar direct measurements and sky radiances were used to retrieve the aerosol columnar size distributions by means of Nakajima's code. Marked changes in the atmospheric aerosol along the campaign have been explained in terms of the synoptic conditions. A detailed study of the columnar properties at the different places has been done. Changes in the spectral dependence of the single scattering albedo under the influence of different air masses have been discussed. The size distributions have been fitted to a bimodal lognormal distribution function model, and the associated parameters have been correlated with aerosol optical depth or Angstrom exponent. In some cases, it has been necessary to develop different correlations for cases affected or non-affected by the arrival of Saharan dust. In the case of Armilla (680 m a.s.l.) and Las Sabinas (2200 m a.s.l.), the small horizontal distance allow us to consider that both stations are representative of the same atmospheric column, a fact that has been used to analyse the daily evolution of the mixing layer in the north slope.

Most of the samples came from the Sierra Nevada mountain range (n = 1,884 and 267, respectively), and all positive cases involved animals from this location. The prevalence reached 0.53% by necropsy and 1.87% by faecal examination. Taking into account both diagnostic methodologies and the total number of animals affected (n = 14), we obtained a yearly prevalence of 0.7 +/- 0.3%. The infection with F. hepatica was found not to be related to host sex, climatology or to co-infection with Sarcoptes scabiei (the most important parasite affecting Iberian ibex, with a prevalence of 49.27 +/- 7.90% in the examined animals). The prevalence of fasciolosis decreased significantly during the period under study and this would be explained by an increase of ibex resistance to this fluke as a result of a reduction of the parasite abundance in the area and/or a reduction of the host infection rate. There was no statistical difference between the two diagnostic methods for the examination of fasciolosis during the period in which both methods were used. Therefore, examination of faecal samples as a non-invasive procedure may provide a useful approach for monitoring fasciolosis in wild ungulate populations. The results of the present study provided foundation for the effective control of F. hepatica infection in Iberian ibex."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0932-0113"	NA	"[Alasaad, S.; Zhu, X.

Ten microsatellite primers were applied on 44 individual S. scabiei mites from three mangy Iberian ibexes from Sierra Nevada Mountain in Spain. Dendrograms of the mites from the individual Iberian ibexes, showing the proportion of shared alleles between pairs of individual mites representing three skin subpopulations (head, back, and abdomen subunits), allowed the clustering of some mite samples up to their skin subunits. This genetic diversity of S. scabiei at skin-scale did not have the same pattern in all considered hosts: for the first Iberian ibex (Cp1), only mites from the head subunit were grouped together; in the second individual (Cp2), the clustering was detected only for mites from the abdomen subunit; and for the third one (Cp3), only mites from the back subunit were clustered together. Our results suggest that the local colonization dynamics of S. scabiei would have influenced the nonrandom distribution of this ectoparasite, after a single infestation. Another presumable explanation to this skin-scale genetic structure could be the repeated infestations. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of genetic structuring among S. scabiei at individual host skin-scale. Further studies are warranted to highlight determining factors of such trend, but the pattern underlined in the present study should be taken into account in diagnosis and monitoring protocols for studying the population genetic structure and life cycle of this neglected but important ectoparasite."

Alluvial fan and terrace incision was controlled partially by a drop in base level during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene as the outlet channel, the Draa river, progressively cut through the Anti-Atlas to the south of the Ouarzazate foreland basin, the drainage of which started to become external after a long period of internal drained conditions. The alluvial fans and terrace surfaces have abandonment ages that date to at least the past four glacial cycles. Their formation was strongly modulated by climate on glacial-interglacial time scales as base level dropped. This demonstrates a strong climatic control on sediment transfer in other intracontinental mountain belts. Furthermore, these data show that mean rates of fluvial incision in this region range between 0.3 and 1.0 mm a(-1) for the latter part of the Quaternary.

A detailed spatial and temporal analysis of global solar radiation on the earth surface is needed in many applications, ranging from solar energy uses to the study of agricultural, forest and biological processes. At local scales, the topography is the most important factor in the distribution of solar radiation on the surface. The variability of the elevation, the surface orientation and the obstructions due to elevations are a source of great local differences in insolation and, consequently, in other variables as ground temperature. For this reason, several models based on GIS techniques have been recently developed, integrating topography to obtain the solar radiation on the surface. In this work, global radiation is analyzed with the Solar Analyst, a model implemented on ArcView, that computes the topographic parameters: altitude, latitude, slope and orientation (azimuth) and shadow effects. Solar Analyst uses as input parameters the diffuse fraction and the transmittance. These parameters are not usually available in radiometric networks in mountainous areas. In this work, a method to obtain both parameters from global radiation is proposed. Global radiation data obtained in two networks of radiometric stations is used: one located in Sierra Magina Natural Park (Spain) with 11 stations and another one located on the surroundings of Sierra Nevada Natural Park (Spain) with 14 stations. Daily solar irradiation is calculated from a digital terrain model (DTM), the daily diffuse fraction, K, and daily atmospheric transmittivity, tau. Results provided by the model have been compared with measured values. An overestimation for high elevations is observed, whereas low altitudes present underestimation. The best performance was also reported during summer months, and the worst results were obtained during winter. Finally, a yearly global solar irradiation map has been produced for the studied zone.

The implementation of such renewable energy systems is especially important in places like natural parks, where acoustic and fossil fuel derived contamination has to be completely avoided. Measure of solar radiation is usually accomplished by means of radiometric station nets with a low spatial resolution. To estimate the radiation in sites located away from the stations, different interpolation/extrapolation techniques may be used. These methods are valid on places where the spatial variability of radiation is not significant, but becomes less accurate if complex terrain areas are present in between the radiometric stations. As an alternative, artificial intelligence techniques have been used in this work, along with a 20 in resolution digital model of terrain. The inputs to the network have been selected using the automatic relevance determination methodology. The data set contains 3 years' data of daily global radiation measured at 12 different stations located in the north face of the Sierra Nevada National Park in the surroundings of Hueneja (Granada), a town located in the South East of Spain. The stations altitude varies from 1000 to 1700 m. The goal of this work has been to estimate daily global irradiation on stations located in a complex terrain, and the values estimated by the neural network model have been compared with the measured ones leading to a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.0% and a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.2%, both expressed as a percentage of the mean value. Performance achieved individually for each of the stations lies in the range [5.0-7.5]% for the RMSE and [-1.2 to +2.11% for the MBE. Results point out artificial neural networks as an efficient and easy methodology for calculating solar radiation levels over complex mountain terrains from only one radionnetric station data. In addition, this methodology can be applied to other areas with a complex topography. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0960-1481"	NA	"[Bosch, J.

From 1991 to 1995, pupal exuviae were collected at irregular intervals in the permanent stream, but the temporary stream was dry because of a long-lasting drought in the region. From March 1996 to March 2000, pupal exuviae were collected fortnightly in both streams. In contrast to other comparative studies that found more species in permanent than in temporary streams, our 2 streams harbored similar temporal I and a diversity during the 1996 to 2000 study period. This result might be explained by the relatively long time the temporary stream was flowing. In addition, the temporary stream showed higher temporal P diversity than the permanent stream, a result that might be attributable to the greater variability in temperature and substrates in the temporary stream. Spates scarcely affected alpha diversity and favored colonization by new species in both streams, a result that supports the patch-dynamic concept of streams. A period of >1 y without spates also resulted in colonization by new species in the permanent stream, but led to a pool phase in the temporary stream that reduced cc diversity considerably. Overall, both streams had similar chironomid species richness and species rarity and high faunal complementarity. These results support the view that temporary aquatic habitats deserve consideration in conservation plans designed to protect species and their habitats."

LEHMANN (2004) raised Tetrix bipunctata kraussi (Saulcy) to species distinct from T. bipunctata (L.); this option is consolidated a posteriori by the sympatry of both taxa, known in several localities. 2-la. The name Monopterus Fischer von Waldheim, 1846, whom the European species Gryllus frigidus Boheman, 1846, pertains, is a more recent homonym, and thus not valid, of Monopterus Lacepede, 1800 (Poisson SYNBRANCHIDAE); 2-lb. Recent genetic studies show that Gryllus frigidus Boheman must be put in the Nearctic genus Melanoplus Stal (with which Bohemanella be-comes synonymous, then); 2-2. Two specific epithets referring to the same species, Gryllus frigidus Boheman, and Monopterus gracilis Fischer von Waldheim, were created on the same year (1846); the first one is used more, and for this reason it must to be preserved, waiting for a decision from the Commission. 3. The name LOCUSTINAE Kirby, 1825, is prioritary over the younger synonymous name OEDIPODINAE Walker, 1870. 4. The name Psophus Fieber 1853 (not 1852!) is not identical to the name Psopha Fieber 1852; it is thus valid. 5. The family-group name PARAPLEURINI Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1893, is available because it is built on the genus name Parapleurus Fischer, 1853; MECOSTHETINI HEBARD, 1924, VICHET1NI HARZ, 1975, and CERACRINI YIN, 1984, are younger synonyms. 6. The genus-group name Euthystira, created by Fieber in 1853, is often used at the subgenus level; however, the conformation of its ovipositor can to apologise to keep it at the genus level. 7. Stenobothrus stigmaticus (Rambur, 1838) is missing today in the type locality (Nevada Sierra, Spain), and the type is lost; then, one can think that this name refers in fact to Omocestus panteli (Bolivar, 1887); it is thus necessary to ask for the Commission to maintain the current spelling. 8. The name Crotalacris Chopard, 1952, seems to be no more than a younger synonym, and thus invalidate, of the name Stenobothrodes Tarbinsky, 1848. 9. No old specific epithet being available to validly refer to Gryllus miniatus Charpentier (= Stenobothrus rubicundus auctores, not Goeze, 1778, nec Germar, 1817), it was necessary to forge an entirely new name: it was rubicundulus, created by KRUSEMAN & JEEKEL (1967b). 10. It is necessary to ask the Commission to solve contradiction between Article 16.2 of the I.C.Z.N. (which requires, for the creation of a name of family group, to fix the type genus, with name of author and date), and the Recommendation 16.B (which only \"advises\" it). 11. To know by which subspecies Aeropedellus variegatus (Fischer von Waldheim) is represented in the French Alps, it will be necessary initially to designate a neotype for the nominate subspecies, and to specify its morphological characteristics."

Results from the analysis are accumulated and expressed as an index of relative active tectonics (Iat), which we divide into four classes from relatively low to highest tectonic activity. The study area along the southwest border of the Sierra Nevada in southern Spain is an ideal location to test the concept of an index to predict relative tectonic activity on a basis of area rather than a single valley or mountain front. The study area has variable rates of active tectonics resulting from the collision of Africa with Europe that has produced linear east-west anticlinal forms, as well as extension with variable vertical rates of normal faulting to about 0.5 m/ky.

The reliability of this record is supported by comparison with that of Padul (Sierra Nevada, Spain). Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterised by fluctuations in Quercus forest cover in response to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate variability. MIS 2 was characterised by the dominance of semi-desert vegetation. Despite overall dry and cold conditions during MIS 2, Heinrich events (HEs) 2 and 1 were distinguished from the last glacial maximum by more intensely and conditions. Taxon-specific vegetation responses to a tripartite climatic structure within the HEs are observed. In MIS 1, the Bolling-Allerod was marked by rapid afforestation, while a re-expansion of semi-desert environments occurred during the Younger Dryas. The maximum development of mixed Quercus forest occurred between 11.7 and 5.4 cal ka BP, with forest decline since 5.4 cal ka BP. On orbital timescales, a long-term expansion of semi-desert vegetation from MIS 3 into MIS 2 reflects global ice-volume trends, while Holocene arboreal decline reflects summer insolation decrease. The influence of precession on the amplitude of forest development and vegetation composition is also detected. (C) 2008 University of Washington.

However, when both stress sources meet in the same community, the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms is poorly understood. We ask: What is the relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic mechanisms of facilitation of tree saplings by shrubs in Mediterranean mountain forests? Location: Sierra Nevada, SE Spain (1800-1850 m a.s.l.) Methods: Saplings of four tree taxa ( Acer opalus ssp. granatense, Quercus ilex, Pinus nigra ssp. salzmanii and P. sylvestris var. nevadensis) were planted following a 2 x 2 factorial design: two levels of herbivory ( control and ungulate exclusion) and two microhabitats ( under shrubs and in open areas). Sapling survival and growth were monitored for five years. Results: Shrubs had positive effects on sapling survival both in control and ungulate excluded plots. This effect was species-specific, with shrubs increasing the survival of Acer opalus and Quercus ilex three and twofold, respectively, but having a minor effect on the Pinus species. Herbivory damage was also species-specific, being much higher for Acer opalus than for any other species. Shrubs did not protect saplings of any species against ungulates. Thus, all Acer saplings ( the most damaged species) suffered herbivory outside the exclosures, which largely reduced sapling height. Conclusions: Protection from abiotic stress ( summer drought and winter frost) was much more relevant than protection from biotic stress ( herbivory). However, we propose that the final balance between the two mechanisms can be expected to vary strongly between sites, depending on the relative magnitude of the different sources of stress and the intrinsic traits ( e. g. palatability) of the species interacting."

In generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated selection on corolla shape is even more difficult. In this study, we explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (large bees, small bees and bee flies) discriminate between different corolla shapes when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow petals, whereas bee flies prefer flowers with rounded overlapping petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the populations where large or small bees are the most abundant pollinator groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without specialization."

We experimentally determine the effect of damage by wild boars (Sus scrofa) in recruitment rate and spatial pattern of a Mediterranean tree, the holm oak (Quercus ilex). We monitored oak establishment in the Sierra Nevada of southeastern Spain during 4 years (1999-2002) in four plots, two fenced and two unfenced that were used as controls. In addition, we planted 1-year-old seedlings in all microhabitats, both in fenced and control plots. to experimentally determine the effect of wild boar on their microhabitat-dependent survival. Despite seedling abundance being similar inside and outside the fences, sapling abundance diminished up to 50% in unfenced plots compared to fenced plots. Wild boars also seemed to modify the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings. Whereas seedlings were most abundant under pines both in fenced and control plots, sapling abundance was highest under pine trees in fenced plots, but similarly abundant under pines or shrubs in control plots. This change in spatial pattern was due to the effect of wild boars killing seedlings when looking for food under pines. The effects of the different mortality factors were not additive. Where ungulates are absent, recruitment is high and occurs under oaks and especially under pines. Where wild boars are present, recruitment diminishes and occurs mostly under shrubs and pines. Wild boars arrest population growth and modify the spatial pattern of recruitment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We experimentally followed the fates of 3,200 marked and weighed acorns from dispersal through the time of seedling emergence over three years. Rodents handled about 99% of acorns, and dispersed 67% and cached 7.4% of the dispersed acorns. Most caches were recovered and consumed, and only 1.3% of the original experimental acorns were found alive in caches the following spring. Dispersal distances were short (mean = 356.2 cm, median = 157 cm) and strongly right-skewed. Heavier acorns were dispersed further and were more likely to be cached and survive than lighter acorns. All caches were in litter or soil, and each contained a single acorn. Rodents moved acorns nonrandomly, mostly to oaks and pines. Most surviving acorns were either in oaks, a poor microhabitat for oak recruitment, or shrubs, a suitable microhabitat for oak recruitment. Our results suggest that rodents, by burying a relatively high proportion of acorns singly in shrubs and pines, act as moderately effective dispersers of Q. ilex.

Many non-exclusive factors have been proposed to explain these altitudinal patterns, including climate habitat structure, productivity, geographical factors, and historical factors. In this study, we investigated the altitudinal trend of beetle richness and diversity. trying to determine the factors affecting beetle diversity and composition along an altitudinal gradient on a high mountain of the Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain), Beetles were sampled every 15 d for 2 y using pitfall traps at 10 altitudinal sites located between 2000 and 3000 m asl. Against predictions, beetle diversity and the standardized richness indices were not correlated with altitude. Insteads, lower richness and diversity values were found at middle altitude in the selected altitudinal range. Although a combination of biotic and abiotic factors satisfactorily explained these richness and diversity values, the main factor was plant diversity, which was correlated with all richness and diversity indices. A second factor was temperature; however, the interaction between beetle richness and temperature was evident only when the effect of plant diversity was removed. Multivariate analysis for species composition showed that 2 factors, plant diversity and shrill) cover, explained more than 50% of the variance observed. In summary, our results suggest a strong dependence of beetle on vegetation structure and diversity. although temperature appears to be a complementary factor determining beetle richness and diversity in the high mountains of the Serra Nevada National Park."

Although it is recognized that deadwood above treeline may have decayed, the absence of such wood is routinely taken to imply the absence of trees for periods ranging from the past few millennia to the entire Holocene. Reconstructed treeline histories are then explained in terms of such variables as slope, drainage, temperature, solar insolation, and precipitation. While these variables certainly help determine where deadwood is to be found above treeline today, we suggest that they cannot always explain where it is not to be found. In the alpine environments of the western United States, archeological work has established a human presence during nearly the entire Holocene in portions of the Rocky Mountains and for over 5000 radiocarbon years in the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada. We suggest that prehistoric occupations may have stripped deadwood from the landscape in all of these areas. To the extent that this is true, reconstructions of past treelines from deadwood may reflect the human prehistory of an area as much as it reflects treeline history itself. We encourage evaluation of this hypothesis in areas of active dendrochronological and archeological research. (c) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."

The study focuses on the Granada aquifer system which is located in an intramontane basin bounded by high mountain ranges providing elevation differences of almost 2900 m. These altitude gradients lead to important temperature and precipitation gradients and provide excellent conditions for the application of stable isotopes of water whose composition depends mainly on temperature. Samples of rain, snow, surface water and groundwater were collected at 154 locations for stable isotope studies (delta O-18, D) and, in the case of ground- and surface waters, also for major and minor ion analysis. Thirty-seven springs were sampled between 2 and 5 times from October 2004 to March 2005 along an altitudinal gradient from 552 masl in the Granada basin to 2156 masl in Sierra Nevada. Nine groundwater samples were taken from the discharge of operating wells in the Granada basin which are all located between 540 and 728 masl. The two main rivers were monitored every 2-3 weeks at three different altitudes. Rainfall being scarce during the sampling period, precipitation could only be sampled during four rainfall events. Calculated recharge altitudes of springs showed that source areas of mainly snowmelt recharge are generally located between 1600 and 2000 masl. The isotope compositions of spring water indicate water sources from the western Mediterranean as well as from the Atlantic without indicating a seasonal trend. The isotope pattern of the Quaternary aquifer reflects the spatial separation of different sources of recharge which occur mainly by bankfiltration of the main rivers. Isotopic signatures in the southeastern part of the aquifer indicate a considerable recharge contribution by subsurface flow discharged from the adjacent carbonate aquifer. No evaporation effects due to agricultural irrigation were detected. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

"Causes of the genetic architecture of south-west European high mountain disjuncts"	"Plant Ecology & Diversity"	" "	2008	" "	"1"	"2"	"217"	"228"	"Plant Sciences ER"	"Background: Postglacial climatic warming in south-western Europe and the retreat of cold-adapted species into higher elevations, starting in the Sierra Nevada and proceeding northwards to the Pyrenees and Alps, should have resulted in a pattern of 'successive vicariance'. Alternatively, long-distance dispersal might explain the extant distribution pattern of mountain species in this region. Aims: Here, we report an investigation of two alpine plants, Saxifraga oppositifolia and S. stellaris, which co-occur in the Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees, and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. Our aim was to distinguish between (successive) vicariance and long-distance dispersal as alternative explanations for their present-day geographical distribution across these high mountain ranges. The patterns found in these two species were compared to those of four other mountain species previously studied by us. Methods: Samples of 378 individuals from 21 populations were surveyed for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) variation. Results: We found that vicariance best explains the phylogeographic pattern of S. oppositifolia, while in S. stellaris, Sierra Nevada samples fell within the group of non-monophyletic Pyrenean populations. Together with genetic diversity evidence, this latter pattern is hypothesised to reflect incomplete lineage sorting following range fragmentation rather than long-distance dispersal from the Pyrenees to the Sierra Nevada. Additionally, in S. stellaris, a distinct genetic cluster from the Massif Central was observed. Levels of among-region and among-population differentiation were higher in S. stellaris than in S. oppositifolia. This may be taken as evidence of a more strongly disrupted glacial distribution of the former species, and also accords with its preference for more specialised and patchily distributed habitats when compared to those of the 'pioneering' S. oppositifolia. Conclusions: In conjunction with our previous investigation, we conclude that vicariance is the predominant, but not sole process shaping the genetic architecture of south-west European high mountain disjuncts. Furthermore, 'successive vicariance' was only observed in three previously studied species but not in the two Saxifrages analysed here, possibly due to the persistence of past patterns of population substructuring."

The gut content data showed that species fed mainly on detritus (as collector-gatherers or as shredders), except B. alpinus that behaved as a scraper in one of the streams. Differences in the larval diet of the same species in different streams, and even through its life, support the idea of not using general models to extrapolate the function of a species from a higher taxonomical level."

Therefore, determining the factors shaping spatial and temporal patterns is particularly essential in the most susceptible, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lakes. We analyzed spatiotemporal variations in dissolved organic carbon concentration and dissolved organic matter optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) in 11 transparent lakes located above tree line in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain), and we assessed potential external (evaporation and atmospheric deposition) and internal (bacterial abundance, bacterial production, chlorophyll a, and catchment vegetation) drivers of DOM patterns. At spatial and temporal scales, bacteria were related to chromophoric DOM (CDOM). At the temporal scale, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in dust deposition and evaporation were found to have a significant influence on DOC and CDOM in two Sierra Nevada lakes studied during the ice-free periods of 2000-2002. DOC concentrations and absorption coefficients at 320 nm were strongly correlated over the spatial scale (n = 11, R(2) = 0.86; p < 0.01), but inconsistently correlated over time, indicating seasonal and interannual variability in external factors and a differential response of DOC concentration and CDOM to these factors. At the continental scale, higher mean DOC concentrations and more CDOM in lakes of the Sierra Nevada than in lakes of the Pyrenees and Alps may be due to a combination of more extreme evaporation, and greater atmospheric dust deposition."

The Ternsamane units, in spite of their external position in the Rif (northern Morocco), underwent medium-pressure low-temperature (MP-LT) conditions (ca. 7-9 kbar; 330-430 degrees C). We propose a new tectonic and metamorphic evolution scenario for the Rif (southern) branch of the orogen on the basis of first (40)Ar/(39)Ar dating on petrologically and structurally characterized white micas. Three groups of (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages are observed: (1) Chattian or older Si-rich (highest-pressure) mica relics, (2) 15-12.5 Ma corresponding to the micas defining the foliation and (3) Messinian or younger late micas and alteration. We propose that the MP-LT metamorphic event in the External Rif is Oligocene in age, highlighting a subduction event during this period which could be almost contemporaneous with the burial of HP-LT units from the internal Rif (Alboran Domain). The exhumation of these units characterized by an intense E-W stretching and by top-to-the-west shear senses, is Middle to Late Miocene in age. We propose a correlation of tectonic and metamorphic events at the Betic-Rif arc scale. We argue that the exhumation of the external units of the Rif (1) is younger than that of the Alboran Domain (internal) unit of the Rif, and mirrors a different tectonic setting, but (2) strongly resembles to that documented in the lower Alboran Domain units of the Betics. We show that a regional E-W extension is recorded on both sides of the Betic-Rif arc during the Middle Miocene. This extension probably reflects back-arc deformation of an eastward dipping subduction that retreated westward during the Middle to Late Miocene in the Western Mediterranean. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A wide range of new methodological approaches in geomatics -such as neural networks, multi-agent systems or fuzzy logics- have been developed. Despite this progress, the modelling softwares available have to be considered as experimental tools rather than improved procedures that are able to work for environmental management or decision support. In particular, the authors think that a large number of publications suffer from discrepancies, when trying to validate their model's results.This contribution describes three different modelling approaches applied to prospective land cover prediction. The first one, a combined geomatic method, uses Markov chains for temporal transition prediction, while their spatial assignment is supervised manually by the construction of suitability maps. Compared to this directed method, the two others may be considered as semi-automatic because both the polychotomous regression and the multilayer perceptron only need to be optimized during a training step the algorithms themselves detect the spatial-temporal changes in land cover.The authors describe the three methodological approaches and their practical applications to two mountainous studied areas: one in the French Pyrenees, the second including a large part of Sierra Nevada, Spain. The article focuses on the comparison of results. The major result is that prediction scores are higher than the actual land cover is persistent. They also underline that the geomatic model is complementary to the statistical ones which perform higher overall prediction rates but produce weaker simulations when there are numerous land cover changes."

The two series in the LPB show a distinct contrast in terms of field, petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data. This contrast also extends to the enclaves, differing in abundance and other features in each of the series considered. Isotopic measurements, however, including Sr-87/Sr-86, Eld and delta O-18 data, show no significant, inter- or intra-series contrast throughout the LPB. These data lend additional support to an origin of all the granitoid rocks in the LPB from a single, isotopically homogeneous, lower crustal source. We also suggest that differences between microgranular enclaves in the two LPB granitoid series cannot be related to a different degree of participation of mafic rocks in the genesis of the respective groups: in both cases, microgranular enclaves are better interpreted as autoliths."

Dry deposition of SRP represented 79% of total SRP inputs and it showed a seasonal pattern similar to Saharan dust export to this region, with maxima during spring and summer. Bacterial abundance was significantly correlated with SRP atmospheric deposition, suggesting the influence of this input on bacterioplankton dynamics. The field evidence was experimentally corroborated using bacterial regrowth cultures performed with dust-amended lake water. Dust addition significantly increased SRP concentration in lake water and it stimulated bacterial abundance. Regarding phytoplankton community, only one species, the chrysophyte Chromulina nevadensis, was significantly related to SRP inputs and, consequently, there was a significant decrease in phytoplankton species diversity after atmospheric SRP inputs. Since changes in climate will presumably lead to an alteration in dust export, these results point to the need of further studies on the potential effects of this alteration on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton dynamics in remote oligotrophic systems."

The initial one, in 1996, corresponded to the reflooding of the basin after a severe drought and was composed mainly of the colonising species Fragilaria rumpens, together with a lesser presence of Nitzschia sublincaris and Hantzschia amphioxys. The predominant presence of F. rumpens at the end of the summer of 2006 coincided with low species diversity (values of Shannon and Wiener Index: 0.3-0.6). During the following two years another assemblage established itself dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, which is considered to be more stable and widespread among the lakes of the Sierra Nevada. The most notable subdominant species (less than 20% of relative abundance) in this assemblage were: Encyonema minutum, Encyonopsis microcephala and Navicula cryptocephala. The diversity values during this second period were much higher than in the first: 1.0-2.2. Nutrient concentrations were measured separately in the linnetic (epilimnetic) and benthic (epilithic) environments. These abiotic parameters show that the dynamics of ammonia and silica were much the same in both, showing a gradual decrease from the beginning to the end of the study period. Epilimnetic phosphorus followed a similar pattern to ammonia and silica. In the epilithon, nitrates and phosphates increased during the first year, only to descend notably during the second. The effect of other environmental parameters such as temperature and the preceding drought on the dynamics of the diatom assemblage are discussed. Ratio DIN:SRP let its test the different degrees of phosphorus limitation in epilithon and epilimnion environments; our results suggest that phosphorus limitation of primary production in high mountain lakes is much more severe in the limnetic environment that it is in the epilithon."

In this study, the usefulness of two serum parameters, total serum proteins (TSP) and serum triglycerides (ST), was assessed in the monitoring of the body condition of Iberian wild goats (Capra pyrenaica). In addition, their relationship with the kidney fat index (KFI) and its components, kidney mass without fat (KM) and kidney fat (KF) is evaluated.

During the LIA, three different glacial environments have been differentiated in these three ranges. A high mountain glacial environment exists in the Pyrenees, where the altitude and northern latitude developed the most complex glacial environment between the oceanic influence on the western side and the Mediterranean influence on the eastern side. In the Pyrenees the LIA glaciation occurred in 15 massifs where there are up to 100 cirques; however, today the glaciers remain only in the highest peaks. A marginal glacial environment exists in the Picos de Europa related to the oceanic influence and topography in an Atlantic high mountain: there were six glaciers in the Picos de Europa Massif during the LIA. A marginal glacial environment also exists in the Sierra Nevada, related to the northern orientation and altitude in a Mediterranean high mountain, where only one glacier, the southernmost of Europe, occurred during the LIA. Several variations of LIA glaciers have been found: historical maximum (from the end of the seventeenth to the beginning of the eighteenth centuries); minor retreat with secondary regrowth (mid-eighteenth to nineteenth centuries); and continuous retreat (from the end of the nineteenth to the beginning of the twentieth centuries); followed by the almost complete extinction of the glaciers and an increase in the periglacial environment. There are now 29 glaciers in the Pyrenees, four buried icepatches in the Picos de Europa and one buried icepatch in the Sierra Nevada. The rise of ELAs from the last LIA glacial maximum until the present allows the calculation of an increase in temperatures of around 0.9 degrees C in the Iberian high mountains."

It is a severe disease of small ruminants, endemic in Mediterranean countries, that is characterized by mastitis, arthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis. This paper investigates the temporal, spatial, and host-related factors in the distribution of M. agalactiae infection from October 1996 to November 1998 and March 2002 to May 2003 in Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) populations from Andalusia, in southern Spain. The predisposing factors to infection among previously selected factors (year of sampling, climatic season, geographic origin according to province, mountain range and metapopulation, sex, year of life, presence of scabies, and phase of the reproductive cycle) were established. We collected conjunctival and ear-canal swabs from 411 free-ranging ibexes. The frequency of infected ibexes was 11.2%. The peak frequency of infection occurred in 1998 and in summer. Granada was the province with greatest risk (odds ratio = 2.6) of carriers (18.8% infected). The predisposing factors were sex (females), age (young animals), and metapopulation (Sierra Nevada). We identified a higher number of infected ibexes in the metapopulation \"Sierra Nevada\" (34/256) and significant differences among the three established metapopulations (P<0.01). Mycoplama agalactiae infection represents a risk for population density and maintenance of these wild populations; infections can result in blindness, malnutrition, and polyarthritis leading to numerous deaths."

Moreover, some of these plants are the economic income for local farmers. Particularly in SE Spain, soil erosion is a core factor in environmental degradation attributed primarily to the cultivation practices and human pressure on the land. Over a four-year period, soil erosion and runoff were monitored in erosion plots on a mountainside, comparing four harvest intensities of four aromatic shrubs (Lavandula lanata L., Santolina rosmarinifolia L. Origanum bastetanum, and Salvia lavandulifolia V.): 0% (HI-0), 25% (HI-25), 50% (HI-50), and 75% (HI-75). Also, the fresh biomass and essential-oil content were quantified in each treatment. The erosion plots were located in Lanjaron (Granada, SE Spain) on the southern flank of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, on a 20% slope, and of 96 in 2 in area. The average soil loss for HI-0, HI-25, HI-50, and HI-75 during the study period was 144.6, 187.2, 256.0, and 356.0 kg ha(-1) respectively, and runoff 2.6, 3.2, 3.4, and 4,7 mm, respectively. The lowest average soil erosion and runoff rates for the study period were recorded with plant cover of S. lavandulifolia V. 67.6 kg ha(-1) and 1.3 mm, respectively. Since no significant differences were found between HI-25 and HI-50 for soil erosion and runoff, and harvest and distillation of wild-aromatic plants currently persists as an important economic activity in mountainous areas of the study zone, we recommend a rational harvest (HI-50), leaving the 50% of the plant biomass in the field (especially for sage and lavender) to avoid the soil degradation. In this sense, the harvest of 50% of fresh herb of sage, santolina, lavender, and oregano produced reasonable essential-oil yield of 12.7, 14.0, 19.7, and 18.3 L ha(-1), respectively. The inappropriate harvest of aromatic plants and the intensity fanning systems of mountain areas endanger land conservation, and there is an Urgent need to implement appropriate land management which has a large-scale perspective but acts at the local level.

Semi-natural vegetation and diverse cropping systems have been converted into monocultures with low tree densities, leaving the soil unprotected. We evaluated the association in soil-and water-conservation systems with production in traditional almond orchards and the beneficial impact of plant strips in mountainous agriculture. Soil loss, runoff and nutrient loss over a four-year period (2002-2005) were monitored in hillside erosion plots with almond trees under different soil-management systems: (1) non-tillage with sage (Salvia lavandulifolia L. subspecies Oxyodon) strips 3 m wide; (2) non-tillage with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) strips, (3) non-tillage with thyme (Thymus baeticus L. Boiss. exlacaita) strips, and (4) conventional tillage on the south flank of the Sierra Nevada (Lanjaron) in south-eastern Spain. Also, the nut yield from almond trees, and the biomass from aromatic-shrub strips were measured. The erosion plots, located on a 35% slope, were 144 m(2) in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. Our results show that the most effective treatment proved to be non-tillage with thyme strips, reducing the annual soil loss by 93% and runoff by 80%, with respect to conventional tillage. Non-tillage with rosemary strips reduced soil loss by 91% and runo. by 82%, with respect to conventional tillage, while these percentages were 69% and 51%, respectively, for non-tillage with sage strips. In addition, all the treatments as a whole, in comparison with conventional tillage, revealed that the plant strips were the decisive factor in the reduction of NPK losses by surface runoff. The average nut yield from non-tillage with sage strips, non-tillage with rosemary strips, non-tillage with thyme strips and conventional tillage during the study period was 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 and 4.5 kg tree(-1), respectively, and the essential oil yield from sage, rosemary and thyme strips was 5.0, 8.7 and 10.8 L ha(-1), respectively. The non-tillage with thyme strips decreased nutrient loading in surface waters and thus had a positive impact on the environment while simultaneously maintaining reasonable almond-production levels. Thus, the combination of orchard trees with shrubs provided a viable option to conserve soil and water in hilly areas with opportunities to increase overall land productivity as well as sustainable agro-environmental measures."

In order to identify the long-term interactive effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and increasing atmospheric nutrient inputs (P-inputs) on aggregate (growth rate, chlorophyll a and abundance) and emergent (evenness and diversity) algal community variables, a 2 x 5 factorial experiment [two levels of light quality (+UVR, -UVR) and five levels of nutrient enrichment] was conducted using in situ mesocosms in a high-mountain lake in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over a 70-day period. Addition of P suppressed and inverted the stimulatory UVR effect on the non-flagellate growth rate (mid-term scale). This interactive effect was propagated as increased harmful UVR effect on chlorophyll a and abundance across the P-gradient. Interestingly, P-pulse reversed the positive effect of UVR on phytoplankton evenness and diversity on the long-term scale. These findings support our hypothesis that the UVR x P interactive effect would favor a few UVR-tolerant rapid-growing species. We show that the algal community is acclimated to UVR-flux but not to high P-pulse. The loss of diversity and disappearance of mixotrophic flagellates may have important implications for the functioning of clear-water ecosystems."

ID-TIMS U-Pb ages for zircon and monazite from these granitic rocks indicate emplacements within a short period of time at 479-480 Ma. Granodiorite G1 is the most deformed rock with shear zones and deformation at the border. G1 and G3 contain fine-grained biotite tonalite and biotite granodiorite microgranular enclaves, which are darker and richer in mafic minerals than the host granodiorites. The geological, mineralogical, geochemical and Sr, Nd and O isotopic data show that tonalitic and granodioritic enclaves and host G1 are of I-type and were related predominantly by a fractional crystallization process. Least-square analysis of major elements and modelling of trace elements indicate that granodioritic enclaves and host G1 could be derived from the tonalitic enclave magma by fractional crystallization of plagioclase, grunerite, biotite and ilmenite. Granodiorite G2 is of hybrid origin. Most variation diagrams for granodioritic enclaves and host G3 granodiorite and their biotites show linear trends. Modelling of major and trace elements of granodioritic enclaves indicate that they result from mixing of relatively primitive granodiorite magma with magma derived from crustal melting. Tonalitic enclaves correspond to globules of a more mafic relatively primitive magma. Granite G4 has the most pronounced crustal signature and is of S-type. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the expected upward shift of tree line ecotones in response to climate warming has not been ubiquitous. The lack of coupling between tree line dynamics and climate warming might be explained by factors other than climate variation that determine seedling recruitment in these ecotones. We want to assess how the availability of suitable habitat for establishment and the effects of facilitation on seedling survival and growth affect tree recruitment within tree line ecotones and modulate their responses to climate. Location We evaluate the relevance of these factors for Pinus uncinata tree line ecotones in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain) and Andorra. Methods We analysed the microhabitat of naturally established seedlings in rectangular plots at the tree line ecotone, assessing the habitat type and the proximity to potentially protective elements that may improve microsite conditions. We tested whether krummholz individuals influence regeneration at the tree line by performing a transplantation field experiment to evaluate the extent of facilitation on seedling survival and growth in height. A total of 820 seedlings were transplanted at different distances and orientations (resulting in 12 positions) from krummholz mats and monitored over 2 years. Results Safe sites for P. uncinata recruits consisted of sparse vegetation covering bare soil, gravel or litter, and close to protective elements that may ameliorate microsite conditions. The field experiment showed that directional positive interactions enhance seedling survival and growth, altering the spatial patterns of recruit survivor-ship, especially during harsh winter conditions (shallow and irregular snowpack). Main conclusions Our results suggest that scarce availability of safe sites and uneven facilitation by krummholz control seedling recruitment patterns within alpine tree line ecotones. Such constraints may distort or counter the response of tree line ecotones to climate warming at local and regional scales."

No major signal of rapid cooling is preserved by the fission-track systems in the basement block associated with this event. Apatite fission-track data from the conglomerates show young ages and short track lengths indicative of reheating. Modelling of the data suggests that heating occurred at around 4 Ma and is linked to movement of hot fluids through the basin. The ability of thermochronometers to record erosional events during the early stages of orogenesis is critically examined and we suggest that in young rising Mountain blocks surface processes are incapable of keeping pace with rock Uplift, and denudation principally occurs via tectonic processes."

Two sets of in situ experiments were conducted: (1) On July 2006, F-v/F-m was measured throughout the day at different depths (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 m) and in the afternoon. ETR and phenolic compounds were determined. In addition, in order to analyze the effect of UV radiation, F-v/F-m was determined in algae incubated for 3 days at 0.5m under three different light treatments: PAR+UVA+UVB (PAB). PAR+UVA (PA) and PAR (P). (2) On August 2007, F-v/F-m was determined under PAB, PA and P treatments and desiccation/rehydration conditions. F-v/F-m decreased in algae growing in surface waters (0.1 m) but also at 1 m depth compared to that at 0.5 in depth. The decrease of F-v/F-m at noon due to photoinhibition was small (less than 10%) except in algae growing at 1 m depth (44%). The maximal electron transport rate was 3.5-5 times higher in algae growing at 0.25-0.5 m respectively than that at 0.1 and 1 m depth. These results are related to the accumulation of phenolic compounds: i.e. the algae at 0.25-0.5 in presentedrespectively about a 3-5 times higher concentration of phenolic compounds than that of algae at 0.1-1 m depth. The protection mechanisms seem to be stimulated by UVB radiation, since F-v/F-m was higher in the presence of UVB (PAB treatment) compared to PA or P treatments. UVA exerts the main photoinhibitory effect, not Only at midday, but also in the afternoon. UVB radiation also had a protective effect in algae grown under desiccation conditions for three days. During re-hydration, the rapid increase of F-v/F-m (after 1 h) was higher in the UVB-grown algae than in algae grown under UVA radiation. After 5 h. F-v/F-m values were similar in algae submitted to desiccation/rehydration under PAB and P treatments as they were in the control (submerged algae). The combined effect of desiccation and UVA produced the greatest decrease of photosynthesis in Z. decussata. Thifs UVB, in contrast to other species, may support the recovery process. Z. decussata can acclimate to severe stress, conditions in this high mountain lake by the photoprotection mechanism induced by UVB radiation through dynamic photoinhibition and the accumulation of phenolic compounds (UV screen and antioxidant substances)."

The Beninar Reservoir (60 hm(3)), which entered into service in 1983, has suffered from severe leakage from the outset, preventing it from performing the water management functions originally foreseen for it; however, it has also made it possible to determine the response of the underlying carbonate aquifer into which the reservoir water is draining. This response has been studied based on historical data as well as the occurrence of an extraordinary recharge produced by a period of exceptionally heavy rainfall. A conceptual model of the system's functioning has been established by analyzing leakage rates, piezometric variations, the discharge through the only spring in the area (the Fuentes de Marbella spring) and the physical-chemical characteristics of the aquifer water. Geological and structural aspects of the carbonate formation were also included. An alternative solution for water regulation in the river basin is proposed: the construction of a smaller dam downstream from the spring. This dam would induce recharge through the permeable base of the reservoir, raise the piezometric level and thus increase its storage capacity, as well as control and regulate the water discharged from the spring."

This lack of consensus might be influenced by the scarcity of studies that examine how the ecological characteristics of plantations vary along abiotic and biotic gradients. Here we conducted a large-scale assessment of plant regeneration and diversity in plantations of southern Spain. Tree seedling and sapling density, plant species richness, and Shannon's (H') diversity index were analyzed in 442 pine plantation plots covering a wide gradient of climatic conditions, stand density, and distance to natural forests that act as seed sources. Pronounced variation in regeneration and diversity was found in plantation understories along the gradients explored. Low-to mid-altitude plantations showed a diverse and abundant seedling bank dominated by Quercus ilex, whereas high-altitude plantations showed a virtually monospecific seeding bank of Pinus sylvestris. Regeneration was null in plantations with stand densities exceeding 1500 pines/ha. Moderate plantation densities (500-1000 pines/ha) promoted recruitment in comparison to low or null canopy cover, suggesting the existence of facilitative interactions. Quercus ilex recruitment diminished exponentially with distance to the nearest Q. ilex forest. Richness and H' index values showed a hump-shaped distribution along the altitudinal and radiation gradients and decreased monotonically along the stand density gradient. From a management perspective, different strategies will be necessary depending on where a plantation lies along the gradients explored. Active management will be required in high-density plantations with arrested succession and low diversity. Thinning could redirect plantations toward more natural densities where facilitation predominates. Passive management might be recommended for low-to moderate-density plantations with active successional dynamics (e. g., toward oak or pine-oak forests at low to mid altitudes). Enrichment planting will be required to overcome seed limitation, especially in plantations far from natural forests. We conclude that plantations should be perceived as dynamic systems where successional trajectories and diversity levels are determined by abiotic constraints, complex balances of competitive and facilitative interactions, the spatial configuration of native seed sources, and species life-history traits."

This mountain range has peaks rising to 3500 m, and is located at latitude 37 degrees N, surrounded by a mild Mediterranean climate. Energy balance over the snowpack is subjected to very changeable weather conditions such as episodic strong low humidity winds, clear skies with very low nocturnal temperatures, intense solar radiation and sudden increases in temperatures. We found the behavior of the snow to be extremely variable throughout the year, especially in regards to melting cycles and evaporation. Simulations, based on snow water equivalent measurements, show that during 2004-2005. 42% of the total snow precipitation evaporated. Only 124 mm of the 300 mm of snowfall collected at the monitoring point actually melted. However, evaporation can range from 80% in December to 20% during the spring months and from 20% to 40% between years. The variability of the balance of energy fluxes acting on the snow cover in this basin means that all fluxes will be important at some point during the accumulation process. This is an excellent context for testing an energy balance model because of the widely diverse situations occurring at this location during the same time period. In order to calibrate the model, it was necessary to remove the stability-correction factors for non-adiabatic temperature gradients of the turbulent transfer, which are important for evaporation. The sensible-heat transfer coefficient in windless conditions is raised to 6 W/m(2) K. An empirical relationship for atmospheric emissivity calculation is derived from the observed relative humidity, as the well-known Brutsaert's formula clearly underestimated this value under cloudy skies.

Here, we used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) of three distantly related alpine plant species co-occurring in the Spanish Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees and the southwestern Alps/Massif Central to establish divergence rates. Within each of these species (Gentiana alpina, Kernera saxatilis and Silene rupestris), we found that the degree of AFLP divergence (D(N72)) between mountain phylogroups was significantly correlated with their time of divergence (as inferred from palaeoclimatic/palynological data), indicating constant AFLP divergence rates. As these rates did not differ significantly among species, a regression analysis based on the pooled data was utilized to generate a general AFLP rate. The application of this latter rate to AFLP data from other herbaceous plant species (Minuartia biflora: Schonswetter et al. 2006; Nigella degenii: Comes et al. 2008) resulted in a plausible timing of the recolonization of the Svalbard Islands and the separation of populations from the Alps and Scandinavia (Minuartia), and of island population separation in the Aegean Archipelago (Nigella).

We also include samples of the closely related, arctic diploid C. bellidifolia in order to explore its origin and post-glacial establishment. European alpine system, Norway and Iceland. We employed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). AFLP data were analysed using principal coordinates analysis, neighbour joining and Bayesian clustering, and measures of diversity and differentiation were computed. For the snow-bed species C. alpina (27 populations, 203 plants) we resolved two strongly divergent lineages, corresponding to the Alps and the Pyrenees. Although multiple glacial refugia were invoked in the Pyrenees, we inferred only a single one in the Maritime Alps - from which rapid post-glacial colonization of the entire Alps occurred, accompanied by a strong founder effect. For C. resedifolia (33 populations, 247 plants), which has a broader ecological amplitude and a wider distribution, the genetic structuring was rather weak and did not correspond to the main geographical disjunctions. This species consists of two widespread and largely sympatric main genetic groups (one of them subdivided into four geographically more restricted groups), and frequent secondary contacts exist between them. The conspicuously different histories of these two sister species are likely to be associated with their different ecologies. The more abundant habitats available for C. resedifolia may have increased the probability of its gradual migration during colder periods and also of successful establishment after long-distance dispersal, whereas C. alpina has been restricted by its dependence on snow-beds. Surprisingly, the arctic C. bellidifolia formed a very divergent lineage with little variation, contradicting a scenario of recent, post-glacial migration from the Alps or Pyrenees."

Spain). They formed at estimated maximum P-T conditions of 1.3 GPa and 475 degrees C, due to simultaneous breakdown of former Ti-rich clinopyroxene and brucite in the presence of 6 vol.% of free water. Breakdown of Ti-Chu single crystals to an olivine+ ilmenite framework was gradual: small relict patches of Ti-Chu appear even at some distance from the reaction front and ilmenite grains coarsen and become less frequent away from the front Detailed TEM data support this interpretation: olivine in equilibrium with Ti-Chu is structurally and chemically homogeneous, whereas Ti-Chu shows ubiquitous intermixed (001) olivine lamellae. Product olivine close to the front shows pervasive and continuous (001) Ti-Chu lamellar faults. These become less frequent away from the reaction front, due to the completion of the Ti-Chu breakdown. This textural sequence suggests both progressive transfer of Ti to ilmenite and progressive release of H(2)O during the breakdown of Ti-Chu. A second hydration breakdown reaction can be observed very locally, in the contact between Ti-Chu and diopside, producing a symplectitic intergrowth of tremolite and ilmenite. Textural features of both reactions point to a very limited availability of water during Ti-Chu breakdown. This suggests that veins operated as closed systems. Complete obliteration of Ti-Chu owing to the antigorite dehydration breakdown can be observed in the Almirez massif rocks. This precludes OH-Ti-Chu from Atg-serpentinite as an efficient water or titanium carrier into deep mantle in hot subduction zones. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of habitat degradation and seed species on the variability of post-dispersal seed-predation rate. Experimental seed removal was investigated in six Mediterranean woody plant species, four trees (Pinus sylvestris, Quercus ilex, Acer opalus ssp. granatense, and Sorbus aria) and two shrubs (Berberis vulgaris and Crataegus monogyna), in an extensively used mosaic landscape on the Sierra Nevada massif (SE Spain). Seed depots were distributed over 2 years in five differently degraded landscape units, each one with three plots: shrubland; native forest; and dense, cleared and fenced reforestation stands. Predation was the highest in native forest, shrubland, and fenced reforestation, and the lowest in dense and cleared reforestation stands, being partially due to a positive correlation between shrub cover and post-dispersal seed predation. However, the main factors driving post-dispersal seed predation were intrinsic to seeds, as species preference explained most of the variance in our model for predation. The plant-species ranking was Quercus > Pinus > Sorbus > Berberis > Acer > Crataegus, the dominant tree species being the most depredated. These findings are novel because they suggest for the first time that species-selection patterns by post-dispersal seed predators tended to remain constant through both study years in all habitats comprising a mosaic landscape, whether native forest, reforestation stands or successional shrubland."

The landscape is a mosaic composed of native forest and two degraded landscape units: reforestation stands and shrubland. We evaluated fruit production, seed rain, seedling emergence and seedling survival in two consecutive years with contrasting rainfall patterns. Seed and seedling data were used to calculate values of seed and establishment limitation. In general, the woody community was both severely seed- and establishment-limited. Species were less seed-limited in the landscape units with higher adult density (i.e. shrub species in shrubland, Pinus spp. in reforestation stands). In contrast, degradation did not exacerbate establishment limitation, which was severe in all landscape units. This general pattern was modulated by the biogeographical distribution, dispersal type, and life form of the species. Boreo-alpine species were more limited in establishment than species with a typical Mediterranean distribution. Zoochorous species were less seed-limited in the landscape units preferred by dispersers (i.e. native forest). Tree species were more establishment-limited than shrub species, irrespective of the landscape unit. Seed limitation, and especially establishment limitation, varied among years, with establishment being almost nil in the very dry year. In the case of Mediterranean landscapes, when degradation from human impact involves a reduction in the adult abundance of the woody plant community (trees and shrubs), seed limitation increases, although establishment limitation is generally high in all landscape units, especially for boreo-alpine species. Conservation and restoration strategies should take into account our results showing that tree species were unable to recruit in an extremely dry year, because more aridity is expected under a climatic change scenario in Mediterranean ecosystems."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the conservation implications of the differences in recruitment of six tree species of different biogeographical origin coexisting in a Mediterranean mountain forest. Under field conditions, we experimentally sowed a total of 16,650 seeds belonging to two Mediterranean (Quercus ilex and Q. pyrenaica), two Sub-Mediterranean (Acer opalus subsp. granatense and Sorbus aria), and two boreo-alpine (Pinus sylvestris and Taxus baccata) species. We selected the three most common successional scenarios where seeds are dispersed (woodland, shrubland, and open areas), and half of the seeds were irrigated simulating a rainy summer in terms of Mediterranean ecosystems. Seedling survival was strongly affected by the type of habitat as well as irrigation. The recruitment of the six species was possible only in wooded areas under wet conditions (20-60%). In shrubland, only Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species recruited in typical dry years (10-50%), but irrigation increased their survival (25-65%) and allowed P. sylvestris to recruit (32%). Open areas constituted the most adverse scenario for seedling recruitment, especially for non-watered seedlings (0% for boreo-alpine species, 1-24% for the rest). Overall, the benefit of a wet summer was more critical for the recruitment of boreo-alpine species (P. sylvestris and T. baccata) than for the rest, although a rainy summer is also necessary for the recruitment of A. granatense and S. aria in shrubland habitats. Our experimental results indicate that the maintenance of current species composition in Mediterranean mountain forests is critically dependent on the periodic, scattered occurrence of wet summers. From a conservational standpoint, the predictions of less rainy summers and greater aridity in the future imply a change in the relative abundance of species in the mature forest, with Mediterranean species becoming dominant and boreo-alpine species becoming even rarer and, consequently, a serious threat for the persistence of boreo-alpine species at their southern distribution limit.

Thrusting accommodated shortening due to convergence between Iberia and Europe. Granitic plutons, intruded during the Hercynian orogeny, form an important component of the basement units. Thermochronology of granodioritic samples collected from a vertical [age-elevation] profile from the south-central Maladeta pluton provide new constraints on the timing of thrust faulting and rock exhumation of the Pyrenean orogen. The Maladeta massif lies within the Orri thrust sheet, presently occupying the immediate footwall of the Gavarnie thrust, a major Axial Zone Alpine-age thrust fault. New biotite and K-feldspar (40)Ar/(39)Ar and apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) data combined with previous apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology and structural studies of the Maladeta pluton constrain the thermal evolution of this massif. Biotite weighted mean plateau and K-feldspar maxi MUM (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages from the highest elevations of the Maladeta pluton (2850 m) are similar to 280 Ma, close to the age of intrusion, and are interpreted to date the timing of rapid cooling in the Hercynian. Subsequently the Maladeta Massif remained close to the surface as indicated by the presence of unconformable Triassic continental sediments. K-feldspar (40)Ar/(39)Ar multiple diffusion domain thermal models from two samples at lower elevations (1780 m and 1400 m) indicate heating initiated at similar to 65 Ma, reaching maximum temperatures of 270 to 280 degrees C. These data are interpreted to record thrust burial of the Maladeta pluton to depths of similar to 6-10 km in the footwall of the Gavarnie thrust. Burial and heating were followed by a period of relatively rapid cooling beginning at similar to 50 Ma, recorded in three K-feldspar thermal models from samples at different elevations (2850 m, 1780 m, and 1400 m). AFT thermal models, in conjunction with the AFT and apatite AHe age-elevation profile interpretation reveal a lower temperature portion of the thermal history. These data indicate the onset of rapid cooling that began at 30-35 Ma, slowed dramatically at 25-30 Ma. and continued at a reduced rate until similar to 15 Ma. Finally, AFT thermal models from the lowest elevation samples record rapid cooling in the Late Miocene-Pliocene, most likely due to re-excavation of the southern flank of the Pyrenean orogen, following burial by syn-tectonic conglomerates. The integrated thermochronologic data set from the age-elevation profile within the Maladeta pluton illustrates the potential for obtaining age constraints related to processes operating within the interior portions of convergent orogenic systems (e.g., the onset and/or duration of thrust fault activity) that are otherwise unobtainable.

Using parallel factor analysis modeling to resolve dominant fluorescent components, we identified a semiquinone-like fluorophore (C9) in the WSOC of deposition that was traced into the lake. At least three fluorescent components, including C9, contributed significantly to absorption of WSOC from atmospheric deposition.

Most of these indices have been checked in faulted regions with high-deformation rates. The application of several geomorphic indices (hypsometric curve analysis, normalized stream-length gradient, and valley width-to-valley height ratio) to the drainage network of the southern limb of the Sierra de Las Estancias antiform (Internal Zones, eastern Betic Cordillera), where low-rate active folding has been recognized, allows us to investigate the suitability of these indices to identify active structures in such a scenario. Hypsometric curves clearly identify regions with recent uplift and young topography, but they do not provide any constraint on the location of active folds. Local valley width-to-valley height index variations have been detected just coinciding whit the position of ENE-WSW active folds. Normalized stream-length gradient index serves to locate active folds in areas of hard rock substratum, but not in those areas with soft sediments (Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary basins). This is most likely due to the fact that in the basins erosion is much more intense than in the hard rock sectors. In view of these results. we consider that geomorphic indices constitute a valuable tool for identifying sectors affected by low-rate uplift related to active folding, with the best results obtained in hard rock areas.

RAPD analysis identified two divergent genetic groups, one containing individuals from the Cordillera Cantabrica and another comprising individuals from the three other mountain ranges. Chloroplast DNA variation was much more limited with only one of forty-two cpSSR loci examined showing polymorphism. At this locus the same allele occurred at high frequency in material from each mountain range. A possible reason for RAPD divergence in the Cantabrian material is its derivation from plants surviving the last glacial maximum ill a northern refugium, isolated from the main distribution of the species spanning the area between the southern and central Spanish sierras.

"There can be major intersexual differences among small mammals in their degree of territoriality, giving rise to a great variety of spatial organization systems which manifest at the interspecific and intraspecific levels. At the intraspecies level, this variety is seen not only between populations, but also within single populations whose spatial organization system changes over time according to the local environmental and social conditions. Taking into account such phenotypic flexibility in microtine social organization patterns, our aim was to study spatial patterns among the snow vole Chionomys nivalis (Martins, 1842) in two study colonies, located in the Sierra Nevada (Andalusia) and Penalara (Madrid), respectively. We used radiotracking techniques to study snow vole home ranges. Animals were monitored in August 2005 in the Sierra Nevada and in August 2006 in Penalara. Home range estimates were based on a kernel application since it provided the model best fitted to the particular set of snow vole locations. We observed clear spatial segregation of individuals with a varying degree of overlap between their home ranges in both localities. Nevertheless, there were also differences between the two populations which suggest that the space use pattern in the Sierra Nevada is related to poorer habitat resources (e.g. food and mates) than is the case in Penalara. Finally, we discuss the most probable mating system in Penalara based on the characteristics of the space use pattern observed."

This extension is programmed in Visual Basic 6 and uses the ArcObjects architecture of ArcGIS.

This provides an optimal integration within the program environment, allowing the representation and comparison of curves directly within the GIS main program. The CalHypso extension can also calculate the main statistics related to the hypsometric curve by applying polynomial fits. We have tested this tool in several basins of the eastern border of the Sierra-Nevada dome in the Betic Cordillera (SE Spain), showing important differences in the north- and south-slope hypsometric Curves. These variations are probably related to the tectonically controlled drainage evolution of the Southern border of Sierra Nevada.

The attainment of isotopic equilibrium during melting of crustal rocks is implicitly assumed in most isotopic dating and tracing studies. This assumption considers the melting event as an instantaneous process and does not take into account the duration of anatexis. To assess the critical role of the timescale of crustal melting, we have studied the unique occurrence of erupted migmatites enclosed as xenoliths in the El Hoyazo and Mazarron dacites of the Neogene Volcanic Province of SE Spain. These xenoliths represent the residue after some 30-60 % rhyolitic melt extraction at P-T conditions of 5-7 kbar and similar to 850 degrees C, and consist of biotite, plagioclase, sillimanite, garnet, cordierite, graphite and abundant glass inclusions (i.e., not extracted rhyolitic melt) within each mineral phase. The timescale of melt extraction was similar to 3 Myr and < 0.8 Myr at El Hoyazo and Mazarron, respectively, resembling the duration of melting events during rapid anatexis caused by basalt underplating and crustal assimilation processes. In both localities, the minerals and glass inclusions of erupted migmatites preserve a significant Sr and minor Nd isotope disequilibrium. At Mazarron the isotopic disequilibrium is most marked owing to the shorter residence time of the melt within the source. The isotopic disequilibrium is not caused by the major xenolith-forming minerals but rather by the accessory phosphate inclusions (apatite +/- monazite +/- xenotime) hosted in garnet and biotite. The preservation of isotopic disequilibrium in these accessory phases has been facilitated by both their intrinsically low Sr and Nd diffusion coefficients and the armouring effect caused by their occurrence within biotite and garnet crystals, which acted as chemical barriers to Sr and Nd diffusion. This result implies that modelling of radiogenic isotope equilibration in natural systems should consider elemental diffusion in a composite medium with a resistance at the interface, i.e. different partition coefficients between adjacent mineral phases."

Numerous laboratory studies have shown that food quality is suboptimal for zooplankton growth. However, little is known about how food quality is affected by the interaction of potential global change factors in natural conditions. Using field enclosures in a high altitude Spanish lake, seston was exposed to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations in the absence and presence of UV radiation (UVR) to test the hypothesis that interactions between these factors affected the biochemical and stoichiometric composition of seston in ways not easily predicted from studies of single factors. 2. Phosphorus enrichment increased the content of total fatty acids (TFA), omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA) and chlorophyll-a : carbon (Chl-a : C) and C : N ratios in seston. The pronounced increase in omega 3-PUFA was largely explained by the enhancement of 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid). In contrast, P-enrichment lowered the content of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), the HUFA : PUFA ratio and, at high P loads, seston C : P ratio. Although phytoplankton assemblages dominated by Chlorophytes were not rich in HUFA, seston in the control had substantially higher 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) content (79% of HUFA) than did P-enriched enclosures. 3. The UVR increased the content of omega 3-PUFA and TFA in seston at the two ends of the trophic gradient generated at ambient and high concentrations of P, but decreased seston C : P and HUFA at all points on this gradient. ARA was not detected in the presence of UVR. 4. The interaction between P and UVR was significant for seston HUFA and C : P ratios, indicating that the effect of UVR in reducing HUFA (decreased food quality) and C : P ratios (enhanced food quality) was most pronounced at the low nutrient concentrations characteristic of oligotrophic conditions and disappeared as P increased. Therefore, any future increase in UVR fluxes will probably affect most strongly the food quality of algae inhabiting oligotrophic pristine waters although, at least in the Mediterranean region, these effects could be offset by greater deposition of P from the atmosphere."

"During a journey to Andalusia (southern Spain) in the end of June 2008 the author made some very interesting observations on ovipositing females of Pyrgus onopordi (RAMBUR 1839). In the Sierra Nevada the butterflies were encountered in more than 2500 m elevation where they laved their eggs underneath the foliage of Malva neglecta (Malvaceae) near ground. The same behaviour and additional eggs could be observed at around 1000 m in the Sierra de Cazorla. Other females were ovipositing on Helianthemum apenninum (Cistaceae, in Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra Nevada) and Potentilla reptans (Rosaceae, Sierra Nevada). From all plants, some larvae have been reared to Imago in order to confirm determination. The usage of the genus Malva is new for European Pyrgus species. In Northern America several species develop on these plants, but records from Europe were considered to be erroneous so far. This is still true as long as species like Pyrgus sidae (ESPER 1784), P. carthami (HUBNER 1813) and P andromedae (WALLENGREN 1853) are concerned and is probably due to confounding the caterpillars with those of Carcharodus alceae (ESPER 1780, Hesperiidae) in former centuries."

We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of open-and early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid-and late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments. Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects."

However, managers from this region are confronted with a lack of information on the effects of fire on most woody species, which is required for defining sustainable forest management strategies. Following a large wildfire in central Portugal (2003), we surveyed the area during the first year and assessed the vegetative condition of 1040 burned trees from 11 different species. Among those trees, 755 individuals were selected and monitored annually for 4 years. At the end of the study, almost all the broadleaved trees survived, while most coniferous died. In spite of the low mortality observed in broadleaves, most were top-killed and regenerated only from basal resprouts, which implies a slow recovering process. Quercus suber, however, showed vigorous post-fire crown resprouting and was the most resilient species. We fitted logistic regression models to predict the probability of individual tree mortality and top-kill from fire injury indicators and tree characteristics. Besides the differences between the two main functional groups (coniferous, broadleaved), bole char height and crown volume scorched or consumed were important predictors of tree responses. Additionally, the main factor determining crown mortality on broadleaved species was bark thickness. The selected models performed well when tested with independent data obtained on four other wildfires. These models have several potential applications and can be useful to managers making pre-fire or post-fire decisions in mixed forest stands in the western Mediterranean Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-jive years ago, the then National Hydraulic Works Authority (now the National Water Authority), taking into account the importance of snowfalls in the management of water resources, initiated the ERHIN programme (Study on Water Resources originating from Innivation). The object of this was to quantify the processes in question and thus enable the management of those reservoirs situated at the foot of the principal Spanish mountain ranges. During recent years, the various systems for monitoring snow cover in mountain areas (measurements based on satellite imaging) have advanced and improved. An IT system (ASTER) enables the volume of water accumulated in the form of snow to be simulated (time-space distribution), thereby facilitating forecasts of snow melt flows.

Decrease in phosphate sorption properties was observed in transects from the littoral zone to dry land (up to the high water mark) in both lakes concomitantly with loss of amorphous oxides of iron and aluminum as revealed by oxalate and dithionite extractions. X-ray diffraction did not indicate increased amounts of crystalline metal oxides, but there was a loss of fine particles (< 20 mu m) with distance from the shore, probably due to wind erosion. Likely this explains the loss of amorphous metal oxides as they are often enriched in the fine sediment fraction. Changes in P-speciation toward less available pools were also observed as a result of desiccation. When re-wetted under oxic conditions, the sediments, especially those closest to the shore, released phosphate to the overlying water. The loss of adsorption capacity for phosphate upon re-wetting was associated with loss of amorphous iron oxides, and the changes appear to be non-reversible. Thus, both desiccation and re-wetting will lead to a decrease in sediment phosphate sorption capacity and increased water level fluctuations, a possible scenario in climate change, can therefore increase P availability in the water column of these oligotrophic systems."

A combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments is used: (i) to quantify in situ settling fluxes; (ii) to study the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) release or uptake by settling and resuspended particles; and (iii) to discriminate between the biotic and abiotic contribution for such patterns. In general, all suspensions (lake water untreated and lake water enriched with settling and with resuspended matter) in both study lakes release significantly more SRP to the solution when biological activity was suppressed. Biological uptake from settling and resuspended matter is likely to be limited by the bacteria] consumption of P. Despite of these similarities, this study has revealed notable differences in the effect of sediment resuspension on SRP dynamics in both study lakes, when simulating natural conditions (biotic and abiotic processes). While in LC, the enrichment of lake water with settling and with resuspended matter did not cause an increase in SRP concentrations in lake water, SRP concentrations in RS at the end of the experiment were significantly higher (probability P < 0.05) in lake water enriched with resuspended matter (3.2 mu g/l) than in natural lake water (lower than the detection limit). Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect that sediment resuspension, which occurs more frequently in RS compared with LC, affects drastically the SRP availability in the water column in RS.

"The bibliographical data (Schimper 1848, Cabrera 1911, 1914, Chapman and Buck 1905, and even the more recent data from Rodriguez de la Zubia 1967) available on Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) unveils a woeful situation in terms of number of individuals and population nucleus. However, a note of hope is sounded in terms of evolution and dispersion of populations over the last 10 years, when a different approach and data on the number of Spanish ibex hunted in Andalusia over the last 50 years are taken into account. The analysis properly distinguishes between certain milestones, including the designation of hunting reserves, the mange outbreak and the designation of Sierra Nevada National Park, which have led to strategic changes in Spanish ibex management measures and have had an impact on the current status of the populations. Prior to the creation of national reserves or hunting preserves, there are few references on the number of Spanish ibex captured for hunting or recreational purposes. The first records available date back to 1954 in Sierra de Cazorla. In the period from 1967 to 1987 (mange outbreak at Cazorla), the only records available reveal that 99 Spanish ibex trophies were validated in the four protected areas, each covering an average area of 2,072 km2. In the period from 1988 to 1999 (designation of Sierra Nevada National Park), the Spanish ibex has started to expand its home range into the hunting preserves around the Reserve. Ninety-seven (97) trophies from 10 hunting preserves covering approximately 2,800 km2 were validated. The expansion trend has significantly picked up pace in the period from 2000 to 2008, with 151 trophies in 8 years in an area covering 2,800 km2 (excluding the National Park). The validated ibex trophies come from 41 hunting preserves, most of which are located in the vicinity of Sierra Nevada. The expansion of wild goats has fostered by changes in land use, abandonment of forests and forest management. The protection afforded by National Park purposes may explain the spectacular expansion of goats towards the immediate surroundings, including Gador, Lujar and Huetor. Thus, the density of the core nucleus has not been overreached and the possibility of hunting this species has increased, in particular for local hunting associations and preserves."

Fire severity is important to ecosystem properties and processes and to forest management but it has been neglected by wildland fire research in Europe. In this study, we compare fire severity between maritime pine (PS) woodland and other forest (OF) types, identify other variables influent on fire severity, and describe its variation. We sampled contiguous, paired stands of PS and OF cover types - including deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and short-needled mountain conifers - that burned under very high to extreme fire danger in northwestern Portugal. Data on stand characteristics and fire severity metrics were collected in plots along transects perpendicular to the PS-OF boundary. Fire severity was rated in separate for the tree canopy, understorey vegetation and forest floor layers, and then an average (composite) fire severity rating was calculated. Fire intensity inferred from stem char height (adjusted for the effects of other factors) was highest in PS, followed by deciduous broadleaved woodland and short-needled conifer forest. With a few exceptions, all fire severity ratings were significantly different between PS and OF at all sites. Most fire severity metrics and ratings were correlated. The distance for fire severity minimization did not differ between OF types (median = 21 m). Variation in composite fire severity was accounted for by a classification tree (R(2) = 0.44) based on cover type (contributing with 51% to the overall explanation), stand variables, aspect, distance to the PS-OF edge and fire spread pattern. Except for a more immediate decline in deciduous broadleaves, fire severity rating was not affected by OF type and tended to decrease in more mature stands and moister aspects. The fire severity moderation from PS to OF was compounded by a dominant pattern of down slope fire propagation into moister topographical positions, exacerbating the fuel effect implicit in the cover type change. The results are consistent with fire hazard and fire incidence studies and support conventional knowledge that advocates the expansion of broadleaved deciduous or evergreen forest as a means to achieve more fire-resilient ecosystems and landscapes.

Under climate change, those effects could signal potential vegetation shifts occurring over large geographical areas, with major impacts on ecosystem form and function. In this article, we studied the effect of a single drought episode, occurred which in summer 2005, on a Scots pine population in central Pyrenees (NE Spain). Our main objective was to study the environmental correlates of forest decline and vegetation change at the plot level. General and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation, mortality and recruitment, and plot characteristics. A drought-driven multifactor dieback was observed in the study forest. Defoliation and mortality were associated with the local level of drought stress estimated at each plot. In addition, stand structure, soil properties, and mistletoe infection were also associated with the observed pattern of defoliation, presumably acting as long-term predisposing factors. Recruitment of Scots pine was low in all plots. In contrast, we observed abundant recruitment of other tree species, mostly Quercus ilex and Q. humilis, particularly in plots where Scots pine showed high defoliation and mortality. These results suggest that an altitudinal upwards migration of Quercus species, mediated by the dieback of the currently dominant species, may take place in the studied slopes.

Pollen limitation may be a consequence of changes in pollinator abundance, diversity and identity. However, no empirical evidence exists concerning the consequences that the spatial variation in pollinator fauna has on pollen limitation intensity and plant reproduction. In this study, we test the effect that changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity exert on the occurrence and strength of pollen limitation by experimentally quantifying pollen limitation in eight populations of Erysimum mediohispanicum, a pollination-generalist plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. 2. Pollen limitation was accounted for by using a comprehensive estimator, the net reproductive rate (R(0)). Nevertheless, we also determined which components of plant reproduction, from ovule fertilization to seedling survival, were more intensely pollen-limited. Finally, we explored whether the spatial variation in pollen limitation intensity was related to among-population changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity. 3. The whole reproductive cycle of E. mediohispanicum was pollen-limited, although pollen limitation occurred more strongly during the ovule fertilization and seed-production phases than during fruit ripening or seedling emergence and establishment. 4. There was a significant among-population difference in pollen limitation intensity. Pollen limitation strength was associated with variations in flower-visitor diversity, and identity. Populations with lower flower-visitor diversity and with many low-efficiency pollinators (i.e. beetles) showed stronger pollen limitation. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows that the intensity of pollen limitation at the population level may depend on several characteristics of the assemblage of flower-visiting insects, such as their abundance, diversity and identity. Our results suggest that any impoverishment of pollinator diversity or any alteration in the specific composition of the pollinator assemblage may exacerbate pollen limitation."

A 2 x 5 field experimental design was used to determine how variations in light regimes (presence and absence of UVR [+UVR and -UVR]) and nutrients might influence the strength of phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling (PZC). We observed unimodal curves for zooplankton biomass in response to increased food supply from nutrient enrichment. These results challenge the \"more is better (or at least never worse)\" concept, since high food levels resulted in weakened PZC. The effect of UVR on zooplankton was nutrient dependent, significantly reducing zooplankton abundance at intermediate phosphorus (P) supplied levels but not at the two ends of the trophic gradient generated (control and highest P level). Neither food quantity nor food quality explained observed differences in zooplankton biomass between light treatments, suggesting a deleterious direct effect of UVR on zooplankton at intermediate food ranges, resulting in a weakening of PZC. The location of this lake in the Mediterranean region has shown an increasing intensity and frequency of aerosol depositions over the past three decades (1973-2003), resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. A combination of these higher atmospheric dust depositions with the high UVR levels characteristic of high mountain lakes might underlie the interannual decoupling between phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics observed in these oligotrophic ecosystems."

WiMMed focuses on the distributed modelling at the cell scale of the digital elevation model and the resolution at different temporal scales in the same calculation sequence in order to better reproduce physical simulated processes. To this purpose, the model was developed and validated in the Guadalfeo river watershed (Granada, Southern Spain), where the topographic gradient between the high mountains of Sierra Nevada and the coast in less than 70 km distance has led to a wide heterogeneity of climate, soil, meteorological conditions (snow occurrence every year), vegetation, water sources, soil uses, and water demand. The topographic algorithms pose a great potential for the study of ungauged watersheds by means of computer techniques from a digital elevation model, and constitute a useful tool for water planning and management that can be technically applied in any other watershed."

Ski runs were selected in Sierra Nevada ski station (SE Spain) in which hydroseeding was performed from 2002 to 2005. The sampling design was based on a chronosequence approach, using natural areas established as 'models' (i.e. target for long-term restoration) to evaluate the restoration success based on the similarity to the model. Although parameters such as growth, cover, and even richness or diversity reached similar values to the ones in the model areas after 4 years (i.e. natural perennial mountain pastures), other indicators such as composition, measured in a qualitative way as the ratio of colonizing species to total species, showed different occurrence values for the most abundant species. Moreover, when the whole pool of species was taken into account using discriminant analysis, the results differed, showing that although the process performed well, the recovery (sensu stricto) requires longer periods than the duration assessed to be fully successful. The results showed that common parameters, such as growth, cover, richness, or diversity, when used solely may lead to misinterpretation, and therefore additional methods to compare composition, such as the discriminant analysis, are strongly recommended.

The tectonic units consist of metasedimentary sequences whose ages are not well constrained. Gneiss bodies included in the sequences have been one of the few sources of geochronological data in this metamorphic complex. New radiometric data from U-Pb zircon dating on gneisses from the western Sierra Nevada confirm the presence of late Carboniferous intrusive rocks in the Betic hinterland. These results, combined with available data from the literature and a detailed structural analysis, suggest that the gneisses represent a single late Variscan magmatic event. Evidence for a close genetic relation between gneisses and tourmalinites is provided by field and petrographic observations, in conjunction with geochemical data, U-Pb zircon (314 +/- 7: 304 +/- 23 Ma) and Ar-40/Ar-39 tourmaline (319.85 +/- 5.81; 317.85 +/- 3.67 Ma) geochronology. A pre-late Carboniferous age for the basal formation of the Nevado-Filabride sequence can be inferred. The gneiss protolith and the graphite schist are considered to be the boron source and the precursor of the tourmalinites, respectively. Superposed tectonic units rather than a continuous Palaeozoic sequence is supported by the occurrence of Palaeozoic rocks at the top of the Nevado-Filabride complex. The nappe tectonics, as evidenced from the contractional character of the unit boundaries and the superposition of higher-grade on lower-grade metamorphic rocks, is additionally supported by the superposition of older on younger rocks as revealed from radiometric data.

The main objective was to determine whether seed dispersal by mammals was related to habitat degradation within a mosaic of adjacent degraded patches mixed with native forest and thereby to determine the potential role of mammals as seed dispersers in degraded landscape units. For three consecutive years, mammal feces were collected in the fruit production period, extracting all seeds of woody species found therein and analyzing their viability. Feces were collected in three different plots for each of five different landscape units: shrubland, native forest, and dense, cleared, and fenced reforestation stands. Seeds from 16 woody species (which represent more than a half of the total fleshy-fruited woody species available) were recorded, although some agrarian species are also introduced in a low percentage of the scats. Seeds showed a high viability rate for all dispersed species, irrespective of the mammal disperser. No differences in species composition appeared in the overall landscape units or in the seed density between degraded habitats. Due to the small patch size, the high viability of dispersed seeds, and the large home range of the large mammals, these three animal species act as efficient seed dispersers for a diverse assemblage of woody plant species regardless of the habitat type within this degradation framework.

Co-flowering related plant species displaying a generalized pollination system can decrease their fitness due to interspecific mating. In this study, we determine the difference in diversity and composition of the pollination systems of two co-occurring species endemic to the alpine region of the Sierra Nevada (SE Spain), Erysimum nevadense Reut. and Erysimum baeticum baeticum (Heywood) Polatschek (Brassicaceae), and check for the potential role of floral and plant traits in explaining the observed differences. For this, we labeled 30 plants in two populations of each plant species located in the same area. We determined flower visitor assemblage by sampling all insects approaching the flowers and contacting the sexual organs during 60-min surveys. We found that the diversity of the pollinator assemblage was similar between the two studied wallflower species, both species showing a much generalized pollination system. However, the composition of the pollinator assemblage was different, since the flowers of E. nevadense were visited mostly by beetles and in a lesser extent by hover-flies, whereas the flowers of E. baeticum baeticum were visited mostly by ants and bees. Interestingly, flower traits varied between species, with E. nevadense displaying yellow, smaller and shallower flowers and E. baeticum baeticum displaying purple, large and deeper flowers. These findings suggest that differences in floral traits can explain the observed differences in the composition of the pollinator assemblage between both wallflower species. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Today, most these areas have become sensitive to human activity, prone to profound changes in land-use configuration and ecosystem services. A consensus exists amongst stakeholders that ecosystem services must be preserved but managerial strategies that help to preserve them while ensuring sustainability are often inadequate. To provide a basis for measuring implications of land-use change on carbon sequestration services, changes in land use and associated carbon sequestration potential throughout the 20th century in a rural area at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada range (SE Spain) were explored. We found that forest systems replaced dryland farming and pastures from the middle of the century onwards as a result of agricultural abandonment and afforestation programs. The area has always acted as a carbon sink with sequestration rates ranging from 28,961 t CO2 year(-1) in 1921 to 60,635 t CO2 year(-1) in 1995, mirroring changes in land use. Conversion from pastures to woodland, for example, accounted for an increase in carbon sequestration above 30,000 t CO2 year(-1) by the end of the century. However, intensive deforestation would imply a decrease of approximately 66% of the bulk CO2 fixed. In our study area, woodland conservation is essential to maintain the ecosystem services that underlie carbon sequestration. Our essay could inspire policymakers to better achieve goals of increasing carbon sequestration rates and sustainability within protected areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The fungus was propagated in trap cultures on Plantago nivalis and Sorbus hybrida and in pure cultures on Trifolium pratense and Sorghum vulgare. Spores are yellow brown to brown, 90-115 mu m diam and form singly in soil, in the neck of adherent sporiferous saccules that form either terminally or intercalary on mycelial hyphae. Spores have two three-layered walls and conspicuous, 6-12 mu m long, spiny, thorn-like projections on the outer wall consisting of hyaline to subhyaline, evanescent tips and yellow brown to brown, persistent bases. In aging spores these projections are usually shorter (1-2.8 mu m) and dome-shaped or rounded, sometimes with a central pit on top where the evanescent tip has sloughed off. Molecular analysis with partial sequences of the 18S ribosomal gene places the fungus within the Diversisporales. The new fungus was found in soil near plants with different living strategies but growing in high altitude soils with acidic pH, high soil moisture and organic carbon content, and close to streams."

Moreover, other studies have shown that the evolution of a fan could strongly depend on feedback between the fan and the mountain catchment. We evaluate if natural entrenchment still occurs in a coupled catchment-fan system, and we evaluate its possible impact on the evolution of mountain erosion. We use a landscape evolution model where the mountain corresponds to an uplifting block and where fans form over an initial horizontal surface. Our experiments confirm that deep entrenchment at the fan apex can occur without a change in climate or in uplift rate under two conditions: (1) the transport threshold (critical shear stress) is significant and (2) the downstream boundary condition corresponds to an open boundary with fixed elevation, which stops the progradation of alluvial fans. A stable entrenchment occurs when sediments reach this limit. The entrenchment can be explained by a strong nonlinear dependence of the transport law on the slope when the shear stress is close to critical. A fan slope increase occurs when sediments reach the model limit, and this drives entrenchment. Fan entrenchment drives strong erosion in the mountain with intensity and a response time similar to those observed for the initial mountain uplift. These results indicate that determining how much of natural erosion is from autogenic mechanisms is essential in order to link landscape entrenchment with past external changes.

They also provide some of the most diverse and species-rich habitats in the world. What is largely unknown, however, is how sediment deposition affects plant community composition in these forests. The objective of this study was to examine changes in plant community composition across a gradient of increasing rates of sedimentation in riparian forests in the southeastern Coastal Plain, USA. Seventeen plots were established within riparian forests receiving between 0 and 5.5 cm year(-1) of sediment deposits. Species density and biomass estimates were collected annually from 2002 to 2006 for overstory and mid-story plant species within each plot. Percent cover and nested frequency of understory plant species were determined annually during 2004-2006. Measures of community composition in the understory, mid-story, and overstory layers of forests were compared to changes in environmental factors associated with increased sedimentation. In the understory, annual, exotic, and upland species had higher importance values in plots receiving high sediment deposition. The densities of shade-intolerant and N-fixing species in the mid-story also increased with increasing sedimentation rates. Increased overstory mortality was associated with high sedimentation rates, though increases in understory light levels in these gaps were not the main driver of understory species changes. Edaphic factors, such as soil texture, moisture, and temperature, were significantly correlated to species composition in all three forest layers, suggesting that changes in soil physical structure due to sedimentation may drive community-level changes in these forests."

A poorly studied factor likely affecting recruitment is the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds. Seed-caching animals are thought to disperse seeds in a way that reduces clumping and density to impede cache pilfering. Furthermore, dispersal might differ depending on whether the seed is immediately consumed versus cached for later consumption, and might differ depending on the ecological context. The main objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the spatial pattern of seed dispersal by rodents in a heterogeneous environment; 2) whether the patterns differ among years and among acorn competitor exclosure treatments, and 3) whether rodents create different spatial patterns of dispersal for acorns that are cached versus consumed immediately following dispersal. We studied the degree of spatial aggregation of acorn dispersal by rodents using two different estimators derived from the Ripley K and the Diggle G functions. We also analyzed various metrics of dispersal distances. For both analyses we used observed acorn dispersal patterns in two years differing in crop size and inside versus outside exclosures restricting access to acorn-consuming ungulates. During 2003, a year with a larger crop size, maximum seed dispersal distances were less, and the pattern of dispersed seeds was more clumped, than in 2004, a year with a smaller crop size. Median dispersal distances did not differ between years. In the presence of ungulates, seed dispersal was marginally sparser than in their absence. Cached acorns were dispersed more sparsely than acorns eaten immediately. These results have important implications for the quality of seed dispersal for oak recruitment that are likely relevant to other systems as well."

For this, the activity of the following antioxidant enzymes was determined: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione transferase (GST), and DT-diaphorase (DTD), together with lipid peroxidation. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was also determined. The four species studied were selected based on significant ecological and biological differences. The results obtained when studying different indicative parameters of the oxidative state of the nymph of different species showed that each has an important enzymatic antioxidant potential, and that differences among species are conditioned by the duration of the nymphal development period more than by whether they come from permanent or temporary habitats. Thus, Plecoptera, although traditionally considered as typical inhabitants of permanent waters, seem to have sufficient variability in physiological mechanisms, together with behavioral and ecological adaptations, to cope with potentially unfavorable conditions that may occur in temporary waters."

We explored the effects of age, body condition and season on relative testes mass in the Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica. We analysed the variability of testes mass from 175 individuals, using a model selection approach based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for a small sample size. The results suggest that season, age and body condition influenced relative testes mass. Allocation to testes mass was greatest in the rutting season (autumn) and at ages that are associated with a subordinate status and a coursing, rather than mate-guarding, reproductive strategy. In addition, males in good condition had relatively heavier testes than those in poor condition. Thus, testes mass in Iberian ibex is governed by multiple factors, and this study leads to a better understanding of gonad plasticity in this polygamous ungulate. The effect of age matches the predictions from theoretical studies on sperm competition, which suggests greater allocation to testes in disadvantaged males."

Our results indicate very high-genetic divergence among populations, high within-deme relatedness, and little evidence of recent migration or population admixture. We also discovered unexpectedly high between-year genetic differentiation (F(ST)) for breeding sites, suggesting that breeding groups vary over localized space and time. While environmental factors associated with high-elevation montane habitats apparently play an important role in shaping population differentiation, additional, species-specific biological processes must also be operating to account for observed deviations from temporal, among-year panmixia. Our study emphasizes the population-level insights that can be gained from high-density sampling in space and time, and the highly substructured population biology that may characterize amphibians in extreme montane habitats."

We analyzed the direct effect of UVR on enzymatic antioxidant responses (catalase [CAT], glutathione S-transferase [GST], and glutathione reductase [GR]) of two calanoid copepod species-Boeckella gibbosa and Mixodiaptomus laciniatus-and the indirect effects of food quality (carbon : nutrient ratio) potentially affecting body elemental compositions and hence enzymatic activities. Responses for the three enzymes were different: GST increased its activity under UVR exposure in the two copepods, CAT activity was null and showed no response, and GR activity differed between species. Light treatments also affected sestonic elemental ratios; UVR exposure lowered carbon : phosphorus (C : P) ratios, which in turn affected the C: P elemental compositions of the copepods. However, nutrient addition had different effects on the two species; it did not affect final somatic C: P ratio of B. gibbosa but had a substantial effect on body elemental composition of M. laciniatus. Finally, the relationship between grazer's C: P ratio and GST antioxidant enzyme activity was negative. UVR and nutrient inputs affected food quality, grazer somatic stoichiometry, and subsequently enzymatic responses. The ability of calanoid copepods to overcome increased UVR may depend, at least for GST, on the elemental nutrient balance of the food."

The southern and western mountain fronts of the Sierra Nevada are fault-bounded, while the northern one is an unconformity between the Neogene-Quaternary sediments of the Guadix-Baza basin and the metamorphic rocks of the Nevado-Filabride complex. We have carried out a geomorphic study by examining drainage patterns and characteristics of mountain fronts in order to reveal areal variations and styles of rock uplift. Mountain front sinuosity (S(mf)), area-altitude relations (hypsometric curves), and valley floor entrenchment differ significantly between the northern, western, and southern mountain fronts. The lack of important faults along the northern Sierra Nevada mountain front, together with the elevated topographic position of the Guadix-Baza basin (average altitude is around 1100 m), points to similar uplift of both geomorphic units (sierra and basin) in a single large-scale crustal block. The asymmetry factors show systematic asymmetries at both sides of the Lanjaron River, probably due to the presence of an active NNE-SSW oriented antiform in the western Sierra Nevada. Finally, river profiles indicate maximal river entrenchment in the western part of the Sierra Nevada, probably related to the uplift of the footwall of the Padul-Niguelas fault-system. Therefore, our geomorphic analysis suggests that the western part of the Sierra Nevada is tectonically active by means of a combination of normal faults along the mountain front and NNE-SSW oriented active folds, which, in turn, likely have a gravitational origin related to the exhumation of the footwall of the normal fault-system.

The case study consists of pine plantations (the focal patch) adjacent to other patches of native vegetation ( mixed patches of native forest and shrublands), and/or pine plantations. Our hypothesis is that input of native woody species propagules generated by frugivorous birds within plantations strongly depends on the nature of the surrounding vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we studied frugivorous-bird abundance, seed dispersion, and seedling establishment in nine pine plantation plots in contact with patches of native vegetation. To quantify adjacency arrangement effects, we used the percentage of common border between a patch and each of its adjacent elements. Frugivorous bird occurrence in pine plantations is influenced by the adjacent vegetation: the greater the contact with native vegetation patches, the more abundant were the frugivorous birds within pine plantations. Furthermore, frugivorous birds introduce into plantations the seeds of a large sample of native fleshy-fruited species. The results confirm the hypothesis that zoochorous seed rain is strongly determined by the kind of vegetation surrounding a given plantation. This finding underlines the importance of the composition of the mosaic surrounding plantations and the availability of mobile link species as key landscape features conditioning passive restoration processes."

The range was extensively glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline - Laguna de Rio Seco at 3020 m elevation - in a paleoecological study documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, fire and climate change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that pine trees grew around the lake, and fire was relatively unimportant at this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Rio Seco occurred before 7800 cal yr BR This is in contrast to lower elevation sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000 cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Rio Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus. Artemisia, and others). The disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand, Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Rio Seco record after ca 4000 cal yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations, fire occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record confirms that even remote sites were not free of direct human influence during the Holocene.

We examined effects of low-severity prescribed fires on counts of birds in a managed forest in the Sierra Nevada of California immediately, 1 year, and 3-6 years after fire was applied in spring. Of 26 species analyzed, counts of 3 species increased after fire (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], and American robin [Turdus migratorius]), and 6 species decreased after fire (Anna's hummingbird [Calypte anna], Hutton's vireo [Vireo huttoni], warbling vireo [Vireo gilvus], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], Nashville warbler [Vermivora ruficapilla], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]). Black-throated gray warbler (Dendroica nigrescens) increased in the first year following fire but decreased 3-6 years after fire. When grouped into guilds, habitat association and foraging guild best explained responses to fire, with the greatest changes occurring for oak-associated species (negative), riparian-associated species (positive), aerial foragers (positive), and bark foragers (positive). Lastly, when we compared our counts to those collected during the 1910s, changes were consistent with those predicted from fire suppression and species' affinity for burned forests, suggesting that results from contemporary fire studies should be interpreted within an ecological context that includes effects of fire suppression. We found that low-severity prescribed fires applied in spring served to drive the bird community towards pre-suppression conditions. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society."

We used topographical variables and downscaled climate warming simulations to build a high-resolution spatial database (10 m) according to four different climate warming scenarios for the twenty-first century. The spatial changes in the suitable habitat were simulated using a species distribution model, in order to analyze altitudinal shifts and potential habitat loss of the key species. Thus, the advance and receding fronts of known occurrence locations were computed by introducing a new concept named differential suitability, and potential patterns of substitution among the key species were established. The average mean temperature trend show an increase of 4.8A degrees C, which will induce the vertical shift of the suitable habitat for all the five key species considered at an average rate of 11.57 m/year. According to the simulations, the suitable habitat for the key species inhabiting the summit area, where most of the endemic and/or rare species are located, may disappear before the middle of the century. The other key species considered show moderate to drastic suitable habitat loss depending on the considered scenario. Climate warming should provoke a strong substitution dynamics between species, increasing spatial competition between both of them. In this study, we introduce the application of differential suitability concept into the analysis of potential impact of climate change, forest management and environmental monitoring, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties of these simulations."

There is a clear influence of ambient temperature on all the profiles, with a lag time of two to five months. Nevertheless, there are clear differences in the temperature depth profile patterns that can be accounted for by other factors. First, there is a greater influence of localized recharge; Guadalfeo River as opposed to diffuse recharge; irrigation return flow and rainfall. Three of the wells located near the riverbed of the Guadalfeo River have extremely variable temperature-depth profiles and show clear river influence. In springtime, during the highest flood stages of the river due to cold melt water from the Sierra Nevada, the groundwater falls in temperature. During secondary peaks in river flow rates during the autumn due to rainfall, the warm water increases groundwater temperature. The effect of the river recharge decreases with distance from the course since there is less mixing with water from the Guadalfeo River. In addition, there are two temperature-depth profiles in which temperature variations remain shallow and follow a pattern that cannot be attributed to the influence of either of the above two parameters. Among these two cases, the most influential factor is the groundwater flow pattern typical of a discharge zone, characterized by vertical-flow components."

Scant information is available on leaf breakdown in streams of arid and semiarid regions, including the Mediterranean, where environmental heterogeneity can be high and the relationship between stream characteristics and leaf breakdown is poorly known. We tested the hypotheses that differences in leaf breakdown metrics would be substantially higher between mountain and lowland Mediterranean streams than among streams within each subregion and that variability among streams would be substantially higher in the lowlands, because permanent reaches in the semiarid lowland streams are rare and isolated. 2. We compared leaf breakdown and associated dynamics of nutrients, fungi and invertebrates in low-order Mediterranean streams draining sub-humid forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and nearby semiarid lowlands of south-eastern Spain. Streams differed between the two subregions mainly in water ion content, temperature and riparian tree cover. We detected higher environmental heterogeneity among streams within the lowlands compared to the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In the lowlands, breakdown coefficients (k) of alder leaves spanned almost the entire range reported for this species from temperate streams, overlapping with less variable breakdown coefficients in the Sierra Nevada. 3. The high variability of k values among the lowland sites appeared to be caused primarily by variability in the composition and abundance of a few leaf-consuming invertebrate taxa, particularly the snail Melanopsis praemorsa. Fungal and nutrient dynamics were less variable among sites within each subregion. 4. These results indicate that the critical condition for stream functional assessment of well-constrained breakdown rates, or related metrics, could be met at reference sites within homogenous bio-geo-climatic regions such as the Sierra Nevada. By contrast, in heterogeneous areas such as the semiarid lowland streams, natural variability of breakdown rates can greatly exceed the magnitude of effects expected in response to anthropogenic disturbances."

Moreover, they allow us to compare the relative performances of presence-absence (logistic regression) and presence-only (maximum entropy, or Maxent) modeling approaches using occurrence data with potential false absences and geographical biases. We also evaluated the recently revised Maxent algorithm that reduces the effect of geographically biased occurrence data by subsetting background pixels to match biases in the occurrence data. Within the Lassen Peak region, all models had good fit to the test data, with high values for the true skill statistic (76-83%), percent correctly classified (86-92%), and area under the curve (0.94-0.96), with Maxent models yielding slightly higher values. Outside the Lassen Peak region, the logistic regression model yielded the highest predictive performance, providing the closest match to the fox's historic range and also predicting a site where red foxes were subsequently detected in autumn 2010. Subsetting background pixels in Maxent reduced but did not eliminate the effect that geographically biased occurrence data had on prediction results relative to the Maxent model using full background pixels."

Adult animals were exposed to different treatments under continuous or dynamic conditions (temperature and photoperiod) to test whether the simulation of field conditions, with changing temperature and photoperiod, induces differences in their reproductive traits in comparison to continuous conditions, with the aim of extrapolating results to the lake. Continuous conditions were the photoperiod and temperature values recorded in the lake at the time when ephippial reproduction is induced. Dynamic conditions were the changing values in the field from the continuous conditions until autumn. The number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium was also recorded by using sediment traps in the lake. Our results show that subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion has a major influence on an obligate parthenogenetic Daphnia population in both the laboratory and field. The total number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium (mean +/- SE; 0.52 +/- 0.12) and the proportion of released empty ephippia obtained in the sediment traps (0.73 +/- 0.05) were similar to those experimentally obtained under dynamic conditions (healthy eggs per ephippium: 0.29 +/- 0.16; proportion of released empty ephippia: 0.79 +/- 0.11), suggesting that ephippial egg abortion and empty ephippia production are frequent in nature. This is the first study to describe Daphnia ephippial egg abortion and compare subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion between experimental and field conditions. This approach is recommended for future research into Daphnia or cladoceran reproduction."

Recent field observations as well as rearings revealed supplementary information on preimaginal instars, cocoon characters, habitat preference and foodplants. An account of the poorly known life cycle of the complex of H. paradoxa is given; larva, hibernaculum, cocoons of both genders, male antennal structure, larval host plants and characteristic habitats of its infraspecific taxa are illustrated. The paradoxa-complex is recognized as a group of localised populations in isolated colonies, which are in the process of speciation. They are ecologically well-adapted and do not move far from their natural habitat. It is restricted to Cantabria, the western half and centre of the Iberian peninsula, northern Portugal and Andalusia. A critical evaluation of reliable characters in the imagines of H. paradoxa and their biology revealed two apparently distinct subspecies: H. paradoxa paradoxa (a neotype ' is designated from Spain, Sierra Nevada, Pto. del Lobo, deposited in ZSM), and H. paradoxa bejarensis CHAPMAN, 1902 stat. rev. from Central Spain. Both are shown to be geographically and thus reproductively isolated from each other. Another remarkable heterogeneity was found between H. paradoxa and populations of the Cantabrian mountain range. The morphological differences between these populations and the known samples of the complex of H. paradoxa as well as its ecological adaptation are interpreted as characterising a distinct species, herein described as H. yerayi sp. n. (holotype [male] via CdFM in coll. Museum Witt, Munchen, and eventually in ZSM). The relationship of H. jellaba DE FREINA, 2003 and H. rifensis DE FREINA, 2003 to the paradoxa-group is discussed.

"A study based on morphological, biometrical, behavioural and chorological considerations, and conducted on 271 male and 252 female samples from continental France, Spain, Portugal and Morocco, led to the following conclusions: 1) the complex Chorthippus group binotatus includes at least two species : C. binotatus (Charpentier 1825), which is a macropterous taxon living in Iberia (up to 2 700 m in the South), France (above all in plain, but up to 1 300 m in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques) and Morocco (at 1 500 m in the Northern Middle Atlas), and C. saulcyi (Krauss 1888), new status, a micropterous taxon occupying the French mountains (Pyrenees, Alps and maybe Cevennes). 2) The nominative subspecies C. binotatus binotatus (Charpentier, 1825) occupies all the Iberian Peninsula, and climbs up to at least 2 200 m in the Sierra Nevada and to 2 000 m in the Sierra de la Demanda. Perhaps it is replaced by another subspecies in Sierra Nevada above 2 500 m, and perhaps it is another subspecies who lives on the French territory and in the Iberian pre-Pyrenees. C. binotatus is surely represented by the subspecies C. binotatus atlasi Defaut 1987 in the Northern Middle-Atlas (Morocco), taxon which perhaps can to be elevated to the rank of species. 3) The nominative subspecies Chorthippus saulcyi saulcyi (Krauss, 1888), new combination occupies almost all of the French Department of Pyrenees-Orientales and the major part of the Iberian Catalan Pyrenees, in altitude. It is replaced by Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) moralesi Uvarov, 1954, new combination in the NW of the Catalan Pyrenees, the French and Spanish Cerdagne and the Aragonese Pyrenees. On the French side of the Pyrenees the nominative subspecies is replaced by Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) vicdessossi Defaut, ssp. new, since the boundary betwwen Aude and Ariege depratments up to natural reserve of Neouvielle (Hautes-Pyrenees), at least. Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) daimei (Azam 1893), new combination is found in the Alps. 4) The cevenol micropterous taxon is attached here to C. saulcyi : Chorthippus saulcyi (Krauss 1888) algoaldensis Chopard 1952, new combination, but this is entirely provisional because several elements lead to see a micropterous subspecies of Chorthippus binotatus, while others elements could make it a valid species. 5) The apparent parapatry of the three Pyrenean subspecies of Chorthippus saulcyi (C. s. saulcyi, C. s. vicdessossi and C. s. moralesi) is problematic; for further taxonomic understanding it will be necessary to carefully study the contact zones, and to complete by a biometric study and a study of acoustic behavior, or even a study of molecular biology, studies should be extended also to the forms of the Alps and Cevennes"	"PT: J BD: Systematics; Nomenclature; New taxa; Combination; Taxonomy; Key; Land    zones; Palaearctic region; Africa; Eurasia; Europe; UT: ZOOREC:ZOOR14712081938"	NA	""	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"1764-6308"	NA	"Defaut, Bernard; Quartier Baby, hameau d' Aynat, F-09400 Bedeilhac-et-Aynat, France, France.; bdefaut@club-internet.fr"	NA	NA	NA	"DT: Article"	"Revision preliminaire des Chorthippus du groupe binotatus (Charpentier, 1825) (Caelifera, Acrididae, Gomphocerinae)."

The mapping process developed to store data about vegetation and flora in the upper vegetation belt of Sierra Nevada (South-Eastern Spain) is shown. The aim was to elaborate a detailed cartography that served into future to detect changes in plant communities. The extension of the crioromediterranean belt was estimated in 3875.7 ha, ranging between 2750-3290 m of altitude. We have detected thirteen endemic plant communities and four variants inside, all of them are commonly distributed with low cover and very disperse form. The total of quantified taxa was 185, with more than 37 % of them are endemic of the Baetic range.

The area is considered one of the biodiversity \"hotspots\" of the Mediterranean Basin. Its high summits are particularly important from a conservation point of view and its flora is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.This paper shows a detailed analysis of the flora in the upper vegetation belt (cryoromediterranean zone) of Sierra Nevada, based on an updated delimitation of its area (38.76 km(2)). In total, 185 species belonging to 44 families and 116 genera were catalogued. The most relevant families were; Poaceae (24 taxa), Asteraceae (20) and Caryophyllaceae (16). Despite its small territory, the high vegetation belt is prominent in endemic taxa (37.3%), 55 of which do not exceed the range of Sierra Nevada. The number of threatened taxa is 39 and the biological spectrum shows the dominance of hemieryptophytes (63.16%) and chamaephytes (26.31%). We believe that this high mountain flora data could be a strong indicator of the long-term climatic variations and might therefore be used in the future to observe possible upward movements of the taxa."

Little is known of the direct effects of Quaternary glaciation-deglaciation cycles in plants within southern European refugia. This study, centered in the Sierra Nevada (S Spain), used RAPD and morphometric data from 36 populations of Armeria (Plumbaginaceae) from five taxa belonging to three species that are endemic to that region: A. filicaulis subsp. nevadensis, A. filicaulis subsp. trevenqueana, A. filicaulis subsp. alfacarensis, A. splendens, and A. villosa subsp. bernisii. The results based on genetic analyses at the population level (AMOVA, genetic diversity, genetic distance) and genetic and morphological analyses at individual level (haplotype phenetic distance, PCO, morphometrics) indicate that: (1) genetic diversity decreases with altitude, probably as a result of the postglacial recolonization processes, except in some secondary contact zones between taxa; (2) gene flow among interspecific populations, most likely facilitated by contraction of vegetation belts, led to the formation of hybrid taxa; (3) genetic distances among populations provide a useful basis for studying scenarios with frequent interspecific gene-flow since it allows distinguishing eventual cases of introgression from hybridogenous taxa."

The study was performed over two consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. Both years were characterised by strong differences associated with rainfall patterns. The first year was extremely dry and had rainfall values far below the mean annual average of 813 mm that has been observed over the previous twenty years. The results of the study confirm that the dissolved inorganic nitrogen:soluble reactive phosphorus ratio (DIN:SRP) showed notable differences throughout both study years, with a greater nitrogen limitation during 2005. The ratio of total biovolume of autotrophic to heterotrophic organisms (A:H) also presented interannual differences. The A:H ratio was generally below 1 during 2005, whereas it was above this value in 2006. Therefore, the main plankton component was mesozooplankton in 2005 and phytoplankton in 2006. Ciliates and bacteria showed a mean biovolume significantly higher in 2005, whereas the biovolume of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was similar during both years. These results indicate a prevalent \"top-down\" control by zooplankton during the dry year and, on the contrary, a predominant \"bottom-up\" control during the wetter year as a consequence of the nutrient limitation of primary production."

One principal theoretical framework exists for such patterns, the \"habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis (HHH)\", which postulates a positive relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. Although HHH is widely accepted, spatial and temporal variability has been found in the relationship between diversity and heterogeneity. Species turnover has been proposed as the main factor explaining spatial variation in the relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. In this study, we tested the role of species turnover in explaining spatial and temporal variability on diversity-heterogeneity relationship in a Mediterranean ecosystem, using beetles as the study organisms. A hierarchical design including different habitats and years was used to test our hypothesis. Using different multivariate analyses, we tested for spatial and temporal variability in beta diversity, and in the beetle diversity-heterogeneity relationship using two diversity indices. Our study showed that beetle composition changed spatially and temporally, although temporal change was evident only between sampling periods but not between years. Notably, there was spatial and temporal change in the relationship between habitat descriptors and beetle diversity. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the changes in beetle composition with the changes in the habitat-heterogeneity relationships. In this Mediterranean system, spatial and temporal changes in the diversity-heterogeneity relationships cannot be predicted by species turnover, and other mechanisms need to be explored to satisfactorily explain this variability.

Located in the South, facing the Mediterranean Sea in a distance of less than 40 km, the high level of solar energy income throughout the year, together with the extremely variable character of climate in such latitudes, make it necessary to use energy balance approaches to characterize the snow cover evolution. Wind and relative humidity become decisive factors in the evolution of the snow cover due to the high evaporation rates that can arise under favourable meteorological conditions. This work presents the enhanced capability of the combination of Landsat TM data with the simulation of an energy balance model to produce sequences of hourly high resolution maps of snow cover and depth distribution under variable meteorological conditions such as those found in Mediterranean mountainous watersheds. Despite the good agreement found between observed and predicted snow pixels, different examples of disagreement arose in the boundaries, most of them related to the temperature and wind speed spatial pattern simulation together with the discrimination between rain and snowfall occurrence."

The most relevant determining factors proved to be elevation, slope angle, slope aspect and lithology. Triggering factors include mainly short-term landslide generation during heavy rainfall, as well as sporadic earthquakes or long-term activation by land-use changes, river over-excavation, etc. Although landslide susceptibility, assessed by the GIS matrix method, is predominantly low, some 15% of the study area shows moderate to very high susceptibility, coinciding with the sites of public works in the region.

Since the 1980s, immigration from the southern shores of the Mediterranean has increased significantly and Spain began to attract attention as an important site for junctions and fractures between Europe and the Maghreb. In the face of current political tensions, debates about the 'self' and the cultural, religious and ethnic 'other' on Europe's periphery have become remarkably delicate. Not only do resentments come to the fore, but there is appropriation of the Moorish legacy of Al-Andalus as well. This article presents two popular performances of historic Muslim-Christian 'clashes' in the Andalusian province of Granada: the Dia de la Toma in the city of Granada and a Festival of Moors and Christians in a small village south of the Sierra Nevada. The selected examples reveal the complexity of identity formation in southern Spain's multicultural reality, the ambivalence in the encounter with its past and present 'Moors' and the politicisation of the public sphere in the course of current regional and global upheavals."

To experimentally analyze the effect on soil respiration, we manipulated a recently burned pine forest in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada National and Natural Park, SE Spain). Three representative treatments of post-fire burnt wood management were established at two elevations: (1) \"salvage logging\" (SL), where all trees were cut, trunks removed, and branches chipped; (2) \"non-intervention\" (NI), leaving all burnt trees standing; and (3) \"cut plus lopping\" (CL), a treatment where burnt trees were felled, with the main branches lopped off, but left in situ partially covering the ground surface. Seasonal measurements were carried out over the course of two years. In addition, we performed continuous diurnal campaigns and an irrigation experiment to ascertain the roles of soil temperature and moisture in determining CO2 fluxes across treatments. Soil CO2 fluxes were highest in CL (average of 3.34 +/- 0.191 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and the lowest in SL (2.21 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Across seasons, basal values were registered during summer (average of 1.46 +/- 0.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), but increased during the humid seasons (up to 10.07 +/- 1.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in spring in CL). Seasonal and treatment patterns were consistent at the two elevations (1477 and 2317 m a.s.l.), although respiration was half as high at the higher altitude. Respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture. Watering during the summer drought boosted CO2 effluxes (up to 37 +/- 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) just after water addition), which then decreased to basal values as the soil dried. About 64% of CO2 emissions during the first 24 h could be attributed to the degasification of soil pores, with the rest likely related to biological processes. The patterns of CO2 effluxes under experimental watering were similar to the seasonal tendencies, with the highest pulse in CL Temperature, however, had a weak effect on soil respiration, with Q(10) values of ca. 1 across seasons and soil moisture conditions. These results represent a first step towards illustrating the effects of post-fire burnt wood management on soil respiration, and eventually carbon sequestration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses research aiming at the development of methods and tools that can be used for enhanced integration of forest and fire management planning activities. Specifically, fire damage models were developed for Eucalyptus globulus Labill stands in Portugal. Models are based on easily measurable forest characteristics so that forest managers may predict post-fire mortality based on forest structure. For this purpose, biometric data and fire-damage descriptors from 2005/2006 National Forest Inventory plots and other sample plots within 2006, 2007 and 2008 fire areas were used. A three-step modelling strategy based on logistic regression methods was used. In the first step, a model was developed to predict whether mortality occurs after a wildfire in a eucalypt stand. In the second step the degree of damage caused by wildfires in stands where mortality occurs is quantified (i.e. percentage of mortality). In the third step this mortality is distributed among trees. Data from over 85 plots and 1648 trees were used for modeling purposes. The damage models show that relative damage increases with stand basal area. Tree level mortality models indicate that trees with high diameters, in dominant positions and located in regular stands are less prone to die when a wildfire occurs."

Aerosol columnar properties retrieved by sun photometry represent a large dataset of information about the physical and light absorbing and scattering properties of the total aerosol, but lack more detailed chemical information about the organic fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. To obtain additional information about relationships between organic aerosol sources and columnar properties, we simultaneously examined stable isotope properties of PM10 aerosols from urban (Granada, Spain) and remote (Sierra Nevada, Spain) sites and diesel exhaust, spectroscopic properties of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) of PA(10) aerosols, and sun photometry measurements. We demonstrated that C and N stable isotopes and parameters from UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy are able to discriminate between aerosols receiving substantial fossil fuel pollution and those influenced by Saharan dust in an urban area. More depleted delta C-13 was associated with low asymmetry parameter, g(lambda), and high values of the spectral slope ratio, S-R, were associated with high effective radius, typical of pollution situations. The humification index (HIX), used predominantly to evaluate the degree of organic matter humification, was significantly related to g(lambda), and the radius of fine mode particles, r(f) and may reflect aging of the Saharan dust-influenced aerosols. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling identified a fluorescent component (C3) with a spectrum similar to that of naphthalene, which was significantly related to g(lambda), and rf. The diesel exhaust sample represented a pollution end-member, with the lightest delta C-13 value (-26.4 parts per thousand,), lowest S-R (0.95), lowest HIX (2.77) and highest %C3 (20%) of all samples.

We studied two types of sedimentary records that reveal a synchronous timing for slope instability in this high semi-arid massif: solifluction landforms and mountain lake sediments. Lithological and sedimentological properties of both records have recorded numerous cycles of different magnitude of slope processes in the massif. Solifluction deposits record seven phases of solifluction activity and soil development during the last 7 ka BP and lake sediments show evidence of eight periods with increased geomorphic activity in the catchments over the last 6 ka BP. Although present-day climate conditions do not promote active solifluction processes in the Sierra Nevada, colder and wetter periods during the Holocene triggered solifluction and transported coarse-grained sediments into the lakes. By contrast, warm phases favoured soil formation and spread an incipient vegetation cover over the headwaters of the highest valleys, diminishing the grain size of the particles reaching the lakes. Lake sediments record an aridification trend in the massif intensifying since 4.2 ka BP that has conditioned solifluction activity to shift gradually to higher elevations. During major cooler phases such as the Little Ice Age active solifluction was recorded back down to 2500 m altitude. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Artemisia granatensis Boiss. is a paradigmatic species for plant conservation in Spain and Europe. It is a critically endangered (CR) endemic species growing above 2500 m in the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). Natural populations have been considerably devastated in the past due to intensive human exploitation for folk medicine. The sparse available data concerning the reproductive biology of this species under natural conditions indicate a low reproductive success. To provide additional information on the reproductive biology of A. granatensis, and consequently information useful for the management and conservation of this species, we studied the breeding system through pollen-tube growth. In addition, some floral and pollen traits were recorded. No differences were found between populations in terms of the morphological traits of flowers and inflorescences. A. granatensis is an anemophilous species, and the data indicate that pollen transfer may be limited between isolated populations, and so contributing to an extremely low fruit-set. Results show A. granatensis is self-incompatible, probably with a sporophytic self-incompatibility system, and with no evidence of partial self-incompatibility. Reproductive traits, related to pollen morphology and settling speed may explain the low rate of recruitment in the small populations separated by geographical barriers."

They have been also inventoried in Almeria province (Andarax river). After detailed analysis of phytosociological inventories and tables as well as for the ecology, floristic composition, distribution and forest structure, we conclude that the A. glutinosa forests of Sierra Nevada represent a new association: Carici camposii-Alnetum glutinosae ass. nova. They are well developed forest with trees, shrubs, and grasses strata, appearing in river banks with permanent streams, on siliceous soils in the supramediterranean bioclimatic belt of the Nevadense phytogeographical sector (Betic province). A variant, indicated by Geum urbanum, develops in high incline slopes with permanent wet soils where A. glutinosa forests show the greatest biomass (canopy cover and height of trees).

As well, the surface area of skin with scabietic lesions estimated during field surveys were compared with measurements taken in the laboratory and the potential for using categories based on surface areas estimated during monitoring and management programs was analyzed. The surface area of the skin lesions measured in the laboratory and the time of year were the main factors affecting mite load. Results also revealed discrepancies between the surface area of lesions estimated in the field and those measured in the laboratory. The highest error percentages were associated with lesions ranging between 25 and 75% of host skin surface area. By reducing the number of categories of mange infestation (from 5 to 3) the proportion of cases correctly classified using data from field surveys increases. Our analyses suggest that the estimated surface areas of scabietic lesions is a useful relative index of mite abundance and/or intensity of parasitation in Iberian wild goat. Therefore, we conclude that revised classifications should be used in the monitoring of sarcoptic mange in wild populations, since data can be obtained in an inexpensive, fast and non-invasive fashion.

Decomposition experiments with alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaf litter were carried out in 22 headwater streams in 4 different climatic regions across the Iberian Peninsula (Cornisa Cantabrica, Cordillera Litoral Catalana, Sierra de Guadarrama, and Sierra Nevada). Streams that were similar in size, flowed mainly over siliceous substrate in catchments with scarce human settlements and activities, and fell within a range of low nutrient concentrations were chosen in each region. Breakdown rates were regionally variable and were low (0.109-0.198% ash-free dry mass [AFDM]/degree day [dd]) in the Cornisa Cantabrica, the most mesic and Atlantic region, and high (0.302-0.639% AFDM/dd) in Sierra de Guadarrama, one of the coldest and most inland areas. Temperature was not the determining factor affecting differences in breakdown rates among regions, and breakdown rates were not related to concentrations of dissolved nutrients. However, microbial reproductive activity (sporulation rates) was significantly correlated with dissolved P concentration. Breakdown rates were explained better by presence and feeding activities of detritivores than by decomposer activity. Incorporation of breakdown rates in assessment schemes of stream ecological status will be difficult because leaf processing does not respond unequivocally to environmental factors when climatic regions are considered. Thus, regional adjustments of baseline standards in reference conditions will be required."

Therefore, three size fractions (1-2,0.25-1, and 0.05-0.25 mm) of 25 topsoils (75 samples) from a Regosol-Umbrisol soilscape (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain) were characterized for fabric by scanning electron microscopy, aggregate stability by wet sieving, and CIELAB color (h(ab), L*, C*(ab)) by diffuse spectral reflectance. A stability-index ranking from 0.17 to 0.98 paralleled a ranking of hat, (88.5 to 66.1), L* (48.3 to 30.2), and C*(ab) (7.6 to 18.9): that is, the progressive increase in stability was related to increased soil redness, darkness, and chromaticity. The reason was an increase in binding agents such as clay, organic C, and free forms coating the surfaces of the aggregates. The values of the correlation coefficients (0.55 to 0.82), factor-analysis variances (73 to 88%), and multiple-regression coefficients (0.40 to 0.65) indicated, however, that much of the variability in stability cannot be statistically explained by color changes. Size fractions of soils with a similar binding-agent content did not significantly (P<0.05) differ in color but they did in aggregate stability. They also showed fabric differences, indicating that the coatings are similarly effective as coloring, while their stabilizing capacity is regulated by size, shape, and arrangement of particles. A close packing of mixed silt sizes stacked like roof tiles resulted in a stable fabric itself. Color can indicate aggregate stability, depending on the binding-agent content, but, being insensitive to the inner particle arrangement, it cannot provide a complete prediction.

This is the result of the direct destruction or alteration of reproductive cell lineages (parasitic castration sensu stricto), or the indirect detrimental effects - for example, via body condition - on the ability of progenitors to produce or rear offspring (parasitic castration sensu lato). There are enormous gaps in our knowledge on the effects of parasites on the testes of wild mammals and in an attempt to rectify this dearth of data we examined the relationship between the skin parasite Sarcoptes scabiei and testes mass in Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica. We considered data from 222 males that were culled in the population from the Sierra Nevada in Spain. Our results provide evidence that sarcoptic mange is associated with reduced size-corrected testes mass in Iberian ibex which supports the hypothesis that parasitism is a determining factor in gonad plasticity in male mammals. We discuss several hypothetical causes of this relationship and highlight the need to deepen the sub-lethal effects of pathogens if we are to accurately understand their modulator effects on host population dynamics.

Abundance and size of adult and young-of-year (YOY) frogs did not differ significantly between stocked and unstocked lakes. We also compared the wood frog population from a twelfth, fishless lake with populations from the 11 fish-bearing lakes (with or without trout); abundance and size of adults and YOY were greater, and YOY emerged earlier in the absence of fish. Based on patterns compiled from a literature review of effects of stocked trout on anuran amphibians, we suggest that characteristics of our study systems, including the presence of native fish, the length of the anuran larval period, lake trophic status, and the existence of complex, littoral habitats, contributed to the lack of major impacts of stocked trout on wood frog populations."

Despite the fact that body stores in both sexes were highest during the warmest months of the year and lowest during the coldest months when food resources are limited, the observed pattern was sex- and age-dependent. The KFs of male goats fell more than those of females in winter, and the yearlings of both sexes needed one season more than young or adults to restore their KFs. Goats of all age classes showed the same seasonal patterns in their Ks, although Ks were lower in females than in males throughout the yearly cycle. In addition, we found strong delayed effects of both snowfalls and population density on body stores, and in years with a lot of snow, goats' KFs reached their lowest levels in the current winter-spring, but the highest in the following summers and autumns. This pattern was less noticeable in the Ks. Population density negatively affected the body stores of wild goats, especially in winter, and the amount of snow fallen in the year of birth (cohort effect) did not seem to influence the body stores in our data set. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of the residuals from the regression between body size and body mass for monitoring body condition of live wild goats and concluded that, although it poorly indicates fat stores, it could be used as a general proxy of body condition. Finally, we discuss the expected effects of climate warming on body stores in this Mediterranean Caprinae species."

Prediction of the probability of fire-injured tree mortality is critical for management of burned areas, evaluation of the ecological and economic impact of wildfire and prescribed fire planning and application. Pine bark beetles (Scolytidae) frequently attack burned maritime pine stands and cause extensive post-fire mortality throughout the Iberian Peninsula. In the present study, maritime pine trees were monitored for three years following 14 wildfires in four ecotypes in Spain (11 fires in Galicia (Galician ecotype NW Spain), one fire in Portillo (Meseta-Castellana ecotype - Central Spain), one fire in Rodenal (Rodenal ecotype - Central Spain), and one fire in Genalguacil (Sierra Bermeja ecotype - SW Spain)). Data on tree attributes, crown and bole injury, ground fire severity, Ips sp. presence and tree survival were obtained by examining 3085 trees. Logistic regression models for predicting the probability of delayed maritime pine mortality were developed by use of generalized estimated equations (GEE). An ample range of response to fire damage in mortality was evident among the four ecotypes and different models were fitted for each. The most important variables for predicting tree mortality were total crown volume damaged, presence of Ips sp. attack and cambium kill rating. The results highlight the extensive presence of Ips sp. in burned maritime pine forests and its importance in tree mortality process, the ample range of response of P. pinaster, in terms of post-fire mortality, as well as the need to develop site specific mortality models for the different ecotypes of this species following fire.

These analyses are especially productive in semiarid areas where tectonic rates are low-to-moderate and Quaternary dating is limited. In this work, we have revisited the most relevant GIS-based methodologies used to assess tectonic activity by using morphometric analyses and we discuss the tectonic implications in two key areas of the central and eastern Betic Cordillera (Sierra Nevada and Sierra Alhamilla regions). In the Sierra Nevada area, the use of geomorphic indexes in the mountain range and in the neighboring Granada and Guadix-Baza basins suggests that all are part of the same SW-directed extensional system. The Granada basin (except in its NE border) subsided during the Late Pleistocene as it is located in the hanging wall of the extensional system. On the other hand, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the NE border of the Granada basin and the Guadix-Baza basin are located in the active uplifted foot wall of the system. Thus, the higher fluvial incision rates in the Guadix-Baza basin can be directly correlated with the most recent uplift history of Sierra Nevada mountain range. In the Sierra Alhamilla region, a geomorphic study shows Late Pleistocene activity along the North Alhamilla Reverse Fault and the dextral transpressive South Gafarillos Fault, two segments of the Polopos Fault Zone, previously considered as an inactive fault."

Last of the expeditions of the Greek archaic colonization, the Phocean colonization in the western Mediterranean assumes a particular dimension owing to a real convergence between the strength of the metropolis' maritime activity, the context of Mediterranean exchanges between prexis and emporia and the opening out of new fields of exploration in the outermost West. In pursuance of that settlement in Gaul towards 600 B.C., Marseilles experiences a period of exploitation of the potentialities (VI - V c. B.C.), along the Gallic coasts towards Spain (Tartessos and the silver mines of the Sierra Nevada) with the foundations of Emporion and Mainake and inland, towards the Celtic principalities of the North-East, then as chief interlocutor in southern Gaul. With the foundation of a series of settlements between Iberia and Liguria, in the likeness of the contemporaneous coloniae maritimae civium romanorum, the Hellenistic era is marked by the assertion of the city over its territory in the face of the native populations and, at sea, by the side of Rome opposite the Carthaginians.

Thermobarometry from the NFC in the Sierra Alhamilla reveals an inverted geothermal gradient, with peak temperatures and pressures of 560 degrees C and 13 kbar reached in the uppermost tectonic unit. The NFC cooled during exhumation, defining a linear PT path that remained within the stability field of kyanite until the aluminosilicate breakdown reaction. Geo- and thermochronology suggest the NFC was subducted and exhumed to the surface within similar to 10 m.y., recording an early stage of fast cooling from peak T through similar to 250 degrees C, followed by a late stage of slower cooling as the rocks approached the surface. The exhumation is associated with a progressive change in kinematics, with early co-axial fabrics showing NNE-SSW-trending stretching lineations, and late non-coaxial fabrics showing SSW-trending lineations. A new tectonic model is proposed to explain these data, in which rocks at the leading edge of the Iberian margin were subducted southeastward beneath the thin, hot, Alboran lithosphere to form the NFC. The rocks at the top of the slab began to be exhumed once they reached 48-67 km depth. They were initially exhumed rapidly along the top of the subducting slab, in a subduction channel geometry; then upon reaching the middle crust, were captured by a low-angle detachment fault with a WSW shear sense and final exhumation was accommodated more slowly in a core-complex geometry."

Moreover, there is scant information about the effect of salvage logging on ecosystem processes mediated by species interactions. We manipulated a burnt pine forest to experimentally analyze the effect of burnt-wood management on the colonization of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) mediated by acorn dispersal by Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius). Three replicates of three treatments were established in an 18-ha plot: salvage logging (SL), non-intervention (NI), and partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass in situ). We hypothesized that different burnt-wood management could alter jays' landscape perception and thus the pattern of seed dispersal and seedling recruitment. We monitored jay abundance in each treatment for three winters and three breeding periods, and jay flights of potential acorn dispersal between nearby oak trees and the treatments. We also searched for oak seedlings recruited in the experimental plot for five years following the fire. Jays were recorded significantly more times (87%) in NI, and movements to this treatment during the acorn dispersal period were also more frequent (81% of the flights). Oak seedlings were also more abundant in NI (ca. 55%) than in SL or PCL (ca. 25% each), despite a strong effect of small remnants of live pines. The results show that the burnt forest, if unsalvaged, still provides a suitable habitat for jays, while salvage logging reduces the strength of this key plant-animal interaction for oak natural regeneration. Nonintervention policies after a forest fire therefore provide the opportunity for adaptive management that helps reduce restoration costs and increase the resilience of the system."

Modern Granada and its metropolitan area, with about a half million inhabitants, are currently increasingly challenged by the highest levels of exposure to natural hazards, by strain on traditional society resulting from adapting to the changes produced by the three decades since the advent of democracy (1978) and by the consequences of the deep economic crisis."

Yet models of competition often neglect important variation in species-specific responses. Furthermore, functions used to model changes in growth rate with size do not always allow for potential complexity. Using a large data set from old-growth forests in California, models were parameterized relating growth rate to tree size and competition for four common species. Several functions relating growth rate to size were tested. Competition models included parameters for tree size, competitor size, and competitor distance. Competitive strength was allowed to vary by species. The best ranked models (using Akaike's information criterion) explained between 18% and 40% of the variance in growth rate, with each species showing a strong response to competition. Models indicated that relationships between competition and growth varied substantially among species. The results also suggested that the relationship between growth rate and tree size can be complex and that how we model it can affect not only our ability to detect that complexity but also whether we obtain misleading results. In this case, for three of four species, the best model captured an apparent and unexpected decline in potential growth rate for the smallest trees in the data set."

Although it is recognized that plant species vary in their flammability, we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how plant traits influence fire and how litter mixtures behave in a fire. As modified fire regimes and climate change shift the species composition of communities, a mechanistic perspective is especially important to understand and predict fire in potentially novel plant communities. This work addresses three questions: (i) How do eight species common in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest differ in their litter flammability? (ii) What leaf traits are associated with various flammability components? and (iii) Do individual species measurements predict multi-species combinations, or are there non-additive effects? 2. Leaf litter was collected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, from eight dominant tree species in mixed-conifer forest. Controlled flammability tests were performed on reconstructed monospecific litter beds and on mixed litter beds, using litter from three species. We tested for non-additive effects in multi-species mixtures using the weighted mean of single-species measures for each flammability component as a null expectation for each mixture; departures from this null indicated non-additive effects. 3. Most flammability components fell within two major axes of variation, one relating to total heat release and another to fire intensity. The eight species differed significantly in all flammability components, with large-leaved species creating litter that burned with higher intensity. 4. Non-additive species mixture effects are common in this system. Flammability tends to be driven by the most flammable component of the mixture. 5. Synthesis. We have demonstrated positive non-additive effects in mixtures of leaf litter. The most flammable constituent species of a mixture has disproportionate effects on the fire environment faced by the entire community. This could potentially influence community assembly and alter the selective environment faced by co-occurring species."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0022-0477"	NA	"[de Magalhaes, Rita M.

At the watershed outlet the runoff, suspended sediment concentration, total solute concentrations and dissolved nutrients (N-NO3, N-NH4, H2PO4 and K) in streamflow were continuously monitored. The runoff was highly variable, ranging between 53.4 and 154.7 mm year(-1), with an average of 97.6 mm year(-1). In contrast, sediment yields were more regular, averaging 1.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The hydrological response of the watershed depended mainly on rainfall intensity. Formerly, 32% of the watershed was forested and runoff was more regular, despite the typical Mediterranean rainfall cycle; however, due to forest area reduction to 17% and the increase in abandoned farmland area (18%) in recent decades, the runoff variability has increased. Greater amounts of solutes (32.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were exported, so that this water is considered as poor for irrigation use. The temporal nutrient export was related to seasonal discharge fluctuations as well as daily concentrations. In addition, the nutrient concentrations of the water discharged were lower than threshold limits cited in water-quality standards for agricultural use and for potable water, with the exception of K (65.9 mg L-1), which may degrade surface waters as well as irrigated soils. Thus, hydrological and erosive processes depended on the watershed features, but also on prior conditions in combination with the characteristics of rainfall episodes."

Floristic and soil temperature data of eight summits sites in two neighbouring regions of the high part of Sierra Nevada (from 2668 m to 3327 m a.s.l.) were used in this study. In total, 102 taxa were recorded (84 genera; 29 families). The species richness decreased, whereas the proportion of endemic taxa increased with elevation. There were significant linear relationships between species richness and altitude and average soil temperature at each spatial scale. However, there was no significant relationship between species richness and aspect variables. Facing continued climate change, the high-altitude flora of Sierra Nevada is expected to be particularly vulnerable and prone to warming-induced biodiversity losses due to the high proportion of endemic taxa, ranging from 23% at lower elevations up to 67% at higher ones."

In this paper we discuss a plausible habitat based on stable isotopic analyses of these specimens, dated similar to 40-30 cal ky BP, probably corresponding with the beginning of Heinrich Stadial 4 (HS4) and the end of Heinrich Stadial 3 (HS3). Woolly mammoth remains preserve an accurate isotopic register of past climatic conditions because they needed to ingest large amount of resources daily (water and fresh food), whose isotopic signature, influenced by the environmental conditions, was recorded in their tissues. The delta O-18(w), values of the past meteoric waters (-5.47 parts per thousand to -6.7 parts per thousand vs V-SMOW), calculated from the isotopic composition of teeth enamel, suggest moderate temperatures in comparison with those of similar age recovered in central and northern Europe. Due to its geographic position in southern Europe, our samples recorded the highest delta O-18 of past meteoric waters deduced from mammoth remains in Europe. The difference between these values and those of delta O-18(w) current mean annual precipitation are minimal, contrasting with those of higher latitudes during the end of the last glaciation (similar to 50 to similar to 20 cal ky BP). The isotopic values of nitrogen (10.1 parts per thousand, to 13.2 parts per thousand vs AIR) and carbon (-20.7 to -21.8 parts per thousand vs V-PDB) of collagen show a dry habitat, which occasionally could have been extreme. Taken as a whole, the isotopic results suggest that the studied specimens lived in a very dry steppic area, with moderately cold conditions, contrasting with the wet environment of 'El Padul' peat-bog, and its colder temperatures, due to the influence of glacial conditions of the Sierra Nevada, the highest peninsular mountain range. The described habitat may be sited in a more westerly position than the 'El Padul' peat-bog, and it was warmer and drier than those of contemporaneous European woolly mammoths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Isotopic, TOC and C/N analyses, carried out on a sediment core, show various stages in the evolution of the Borreguiles de la Virgen, which today constitute a small bog at about 2,950 m above sea level. Glacial erosion generated a cirque depression, which became a small lake during the first phase of infilling (from 8,200 to 5,100 cal yr BP), as suggested by sedimentary evidence, including an atomic C/N ratio generally below 20, low TOC values and the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the record. These results imply significant algal productivity, which is confirmed by the microscopic algal remains. Drier conditions became established progressively in this area from 5,100 to 3,700 cal yr BP. Subsequently, the lake evolved into a bog as shown by geochemical evidence (C/N ratios above 20, high TOC content and low delta C-13 values). Unstable conditions prevailed from 3,600 to 700 cal yr BP; an extremely low sedimentation rate and scarcity of data from this period do not allow us to make a coherent interpretation. Fluctuating conditions were recorded during the last 700 cal yr BP, with wetter conditions prevailing during the first part of the interval (with C/N rate below 20) up to 350 years ago. In general, a gradual trend toward more arid conditions occurred since 6,900 cal yr BP, with a further increase in aridity since 5,100 cal yr BP.

La Caldera (Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain) is an oligotrophic high mountain lake (3050 m a.s.l.) that has experienced large fluctuations in water volume (13-100%) during the past 20 years due to irregular annual precipitation patterns (371-1816 mm). Because of the lake's cold and dilute abiotic environment, it is likely susceptible to projected increases in global temperature and represents an ideal sentinel of global change. We analyze the effect of WLFs on water quality and on plankton community in La Caldera to better understand the potential effects of recurrent droughts (3 droughts in a 20-year period) on lake ecology. We have found significantly positive effects of WLFs on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. There was extreme variability in TP concentrations during three recurrent droughts (1995, 1999, and 2005) reflecting sediment resuspension. However, the data also suggest that this was not the only source of phosphorus. Extremely high P-enriched atmospheric dust inputs could have maintained the abnormally high TP in-lake concentrations measured during 2005. The data indicate that recurrent droughts have reduced lake resistance to TP changes but have increased lake resistance to total nitrogen (TN) changes, which supports the idea that a P-enriched atmospheric dust inputs during 2005. An increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN):TP mass ratio after 2005 was observed, revealing a higher ecosystem homeostasis of this ratio."

Remains of moraines older than the global Last Glacial Maximum exist, but their poor preservation makes them an unreliable subject for surface exposure dating. Results show that the last local glacial maximum advance took place earlier than the global Last Glacial Maximum, but within the MIS 2, although additional dating is needed to confirm this. Exposure ages from bedrock steps show a general glacier retreat in progress by 15-14 ka. Shortly afterwards an extensive system of rock glaciers formed at the base of the valley headwalls, with the most recent rock glacier lasting until 7 ka ago. From their location, morphology and analysis of other proxies, we interpret their origin as related to the deglaciation process and marked instability of cirque headwalls, rather than to extreme periglacial conditions. A recent similar occurrence was the transformation of the Little Ice Age glacier on the north face of the Pico del Veleta into a rock glacier under temperate high mountain climatic conditions.

Their abundance offers the opportunity to establish its origin and to date the ages of acid magmatism and of early deposition ages of metasedimentary host rocks of the orthogneisses, in this complex metamorphosed and deformed during the Alpine Orogeny. Petrography and bulk-rock chemistry indicate that the orthoderivates samples are peraluminous tourmaline leucogranites and strongly peraluminous biotite gneisses. Compositional similarity in different outcrops points to common genetic relationships. Although the studied gneisses are affected by metamorphic and deformational processes their compositional variations may be explained by differing degrees of crustal melting, source heterogeneity or minor feldspar fractionation. Variation in REE contents is attributed to accessory minerals fractionation. The geochemical data show that the protoliths originated by low degree of partial melting of biotite-rich, muscovite-plagioclase-bearing metasediments. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of magmatic zircons from six samples yielded ages between similar to 282 +/- 5 and 295 +/- 3 Ma. Their ages and chemical composition indicate that these intrusive bodies strongly resemble the peraluminous, post-tectonic, leucogranites widespread in the Variscan Orogen, particularly those produced by crustal partial melting of the Central Iberian Zone. Zircons in host pelitic metasediments provide older ages ranging from similar to 336 to 2.050 Ma. They testify to the recycling of Early Carboniferous and older granites, which are found in the Central Iberian zones of the Iberian Massif. The new geochronological data combined with detailed field observations allow drafting a new chronostratigraphy of the Nevado-Filabride Complex. Traditionally proposed Triassic ages for the metasedimentary upper series of the complex are not consistent with the ages reported here, which suggests that the entire complex consists of Paleozoic or older rocks. This conclusion has profound implications on the validity of the tectonic subdivisions proposed so far. Metamorphic zircon rims in two gneisses and a pelitic metasediment yield Miocene (17.3 +/- 0.4 Ma) ages in line with what previously proposed for the high-pressure metamorphic peak in the Nevado-Filabride Complex. The new radiometric data moreover confirm independent metamorphic and tectonic evolutions for the Nevado-Filabride and the Alpujarride complexes of the Betic Cordillera. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The centrality of a given node captures its importance within the network. We hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight individual-based networks originated from the interaction between Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks, each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree. The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate for the interacting phenotype of individuals."

However, studies on the ecology and conservation of aquatic biodiversity within protected areas are still scarce. This study aimed at compiling an inventory of the macroinvertebrate families inhabiting the aquatic ecosystems of each mountainous Spanish national park (Sierra Nevada, Cabaneros, Ordesa, Picos de Europa, Aiguestortes and Monfrague). The results were used to answer two questions: (i) Which environmental variables are related to macroinvertebrate composition and richness in these protected ecosystems? (ii) Which taxon or group of taxa could act as biodiversity surrogates? Sampling was carried out in 81 aquatic ecosystems across the six national parks during the summers of 2008-2010. The national parks with the highest richness were Picos de Europa and Cabaneros. Overall, the six parks incorporated 66.2% of the taxa included in the Iberian checklist. Multivariate techniques showed that maximum altitude and the presence of lotic habitats were the most important variables related to different community compositions. The best richness model included the presence of a lotic habitat, together with the percentage of the catchment area with non-irrigated agriculture and siliceous geology. Selecting several diverse lotic and lentic water bodies at different altitudes provides the best way of representing Iberian macroinvertebrate diversity. Coleoptera family richness may be used as a macroinvertebrate biodiversity surrogate in Iberian mountainous protected areas because it displayed the highest correlation with the other taxonomic groups and remaining richness values. Such an indicator could be complemented with the use of Odonata family richness for standing waters. The adequacy of Coleopera and Odonata as biodiversity surrogates should be tested at a wider geographic scale, and other surrogacy concepts (e.g. community composition) considered for assessing the role of this network in the protection of rare and endemic species.

The downward component, emitted by the clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere, is rarely measured, and is still not well understood. In mountainous areas, direct observations are even scarcer and the fitting of existing models is often subjected to local parameterization in order to surplus the particular physics of the atmospheric profiles. The influence of clouds makes it even harder to estimate for all sky conditions. This work presents a long-time continuous dataset of high-resolution longwave radiation measured in a weather station at a height of 2500ma.s.l. in Sierra Nevada, Spain, together with the parameterization of the apparent atmospheric emissivity for clear and cloudy skies resulting from three different schemes. We evaluate the schemes of Brutsaert, and Crawford and Duchon with locally adjusted coefficients and compare them with a completely parametric expression adjusted for these data that takes into account three possible significant atmospheric states related to the cloud cover: clear, completely covered, and partly covered skies. All the parametric expressions are related to the screen-level values of temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation, which can be frequently found in standard weather stations. Unobserved cloudiness measurements needed for Brutsaert scheme for cloudy sky are also parameterized from screen-level measurements. The calibration performed for a 6-yr period at the study site resulted in satisfactory estimations of emissivity for all the analyzed schemes thanks to the local fitting of the parameterizations, with the best achievement found for the completely parametric expression. Further validation of the expressions in two alternative sites showed that the greater accuracy of the latter can also be found in very close sites, while a better performance of the Brutsaert scheme, with a more physical background and the successful parameterization of the clouds effect, is found in nearby sites outside the initial mountain range. The results show the feasibility for the local calibration of expressions to estimate instantaneous atmospheric emissivity for all sky conditions only using surface data, either with a completely parametric scheme if longwave data are available, or through obtaining of locally fitted coefficients for Brutsaert and derived schemes. Nevertheless, the best performance of the first approach would be at the expense of a reduced local applicability."

The maxima of AOT are used to visualize the transport paths. Saharan dust reaches Europe over the Mediterranean and also by looping back over the Atlantic. In spring, aerosols are observed within a wide range of longitudes in Europe, with the highest AOT over western Europe. This may be partially explained by dust transport to western Europe via the Atlantic route, while to central and eastern Europe, dust is transported over the Mediterranean. During all seasons, dust is transported over the Mediterranean to Europe. In the summer months, aerosols are observed predominantly in central Europe. In autumn, aerosol activity is strongest in eastern Europe. We show that there are local AOT maxima over north Italy, in the Alps, in Spain, southeast of the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, and in the Rila Mountains in Bulgaria.

The earliest part of the record, from 8200 to about 7000 cal yr BP, is characterized by the highest abundance of arboreal pollen and Pediastrum, indicating the warmest and wettest conditions in the area at that time. The pollen record shows a progressive aridification since 7000 cal yr BP that occurred in two steps, first shown by a decrease in Pinus, replaced by Poaceae from 7000 to 4600 cal yr BP and then by Cyperaceae, Artemisia and Amaranthaceae from 4600 to 1200 cal yr BP. Pediastrum also decreased progressively and totally disappeared at ca. 3000 yr ago. The progressive aridification is punctuated by periodically enhanced drought at ca. 6500, 5200 and 4000 cal yr BP that coincide in timing and duration with well-known dry events in the Mediterranean and other areas. Since 1200 cal yr BP, several changes are observed in the vegetation that probably indicate the high-impact of humans in the Sierra Nevada, with pasturing leading to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the bog, Pinus reforestation and Olea cultivation at lower elevations.

Measurements related to ozone injury included visible chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth, which together compose the Ozone Injury Index (OII). The OII values observed in Catalonia were similar to those in California, but OII alone correlated poorly to ambient ozone in all sites. Combining ambient ozone with GIS variables related to landscape variability of plant hydrological status, derived from stepwise regressions, produced models with R-2 = 0.35, p = 0.016 in Catalonia, R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.001 in Yosemite and R-2 = 0.33, p = 0.007 in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks in California. Individual OII components in Catalonia were modeled with improved success compared to the original full OII, in particular visible chlorotic mottling (R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001).

Satellite pixels with 100% snow cover have been selected to derive the monthly mean snow albedo value, along with aerosol optical depth, surface temperature, and days after snowfall in March and April to perform multiple regression analysis. We show that aerosol optical depth, which generally includes dust and black carbon over the Sierra Nevada as a result of the transpacific transport from East Asia and local sources, represents a significant parameter affecting snow albedo variation, second only to the land surface temperature change. The regression analysis illustrates that a one standard deviation increase in land surface temperature (2.2 K) and aerosol optical depth (0.044) can lead to decreases in snow albedo by 0.038 and 0.026, respectively. This study also shows that approximately 26% of snow albedo reduction from March to April over the Sierra Nevada is caused by an increase in aerosol optical depth, which has a profound impact on available water resources in California. However, the results show that there are no significant trends for snow albedo, surface temperature, and aerosol optical depth of snow-covered areas over the Sierra Nevada Mountain area in this 10-year period.

For an efficient use of them, databases have been built following the standards proposed by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), providing a common protocol to query them and make them interoperable. The IRAM 30-m radio telescope, located in Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) is a millimeter wavelength telescope with a constantly renewed, extensive choice of instruments, and capable of covering the frequency range between 80 and 370 GHz. It is continuously producing a large amount of data thanks to the more than 200 scientific projects observed each year. The TAPAS archive at the IRAM 30-m telescope is aimed to provide public access to the headers describing the observations performed with the telescope, according to a defined data policy, making as well the technical data available to the IRAM staff members. A special emphasis has been made to make it Virtual Observatory (VO) compliant, and to offer a VO compliant web interface allowing to make the information available to the scientific community. TAPAS is built using the Django Python framework on top of a relational MySQL database, and is fully integrated with the telescope control system. The TAPAS data model (DM) is based on the Radio Astronomical DAta Model for Single dish radio telescopes (RADAMS), to allow for easy integration into the VO infrastructure. A metadata modeling layer is used by the data-filler to allow an implementation free from assumptions about the control system and the underlying database. TAPAS and its public web interface (http://tapas.iram.es) provides a scalable system that can evolve with new instruments and observing modes. A meta description of the DM has been introduced in TAPAS in order to both avoid undesired coupling between the code and the DM and to provide a better management of the archive. A subset of the header data stored in TAPAS will be made available at the CDS."

The description of 20 conodont taxa and their stratigraphical distribution permits recognition of two separate time intervals. The older one corresponds to the lower Upper Givetian (Middle Devonian), hermanni to cristatus ectypus zones. The younger interval is uppermost Lower Frasnian to lower Middle Frasnian (Upper Devonian) and is equivalent to MN4MN6 zones. The combination of litho- and conodont biofacies supports the distinction between the Sierra Negra and Renanue Subfacies. Conodont biofacies for the studied interval are partially close to the ones from the Compte Subfacies, but lithofacies are clearly different. This faunal similarity fosters accurate correlation between subfacies and stimulates further research aiming at Devonian Pyrenean basin(s) reconstruction. Additionally, this faunal sequence permits direct comparison with regions located in northern Gondwana and in the Russian platform for part of the interval. Comparison with Laurasia, mainly with the Northwest Territories of Canada and the north-western United States, is also provided. Some taxa are also common with eastern and central Asia (China, Siberia, Tadzhikistan, Afghanistan), Australia and western USA (Nevada)."

Following this purpose, in this paper we discuss data from two sources concerning the past evolution of the present-day periglacial environment in the Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula): mountain lake sediments and documentary sources. La Mosca lake sedimentary record provides information about the palaeocological evolution in the MulhacSn cirque over the last three millennia, while documentary sources enable us to reconstruct the landscape evolution in the high lands of this massif over the last eight centuries. During the late Holocene cold and wet phases have favoured the activity of geomorphic processes, with ephemeral development of glaciers in the highest northern cirques, abundance of late-lying snow patches and a decrease of the vegetation cover in the highest catchments. By contrast, warm periods have been more conducive to geomorphic stability, with an extension of the vegetation grass cover, but without glaciers and with a lower density of snow patches in summer. The comparison of the palaeocological evolution and associated palaeoclimatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada with other regional proxies shows evidence of the moderate sensitivity of the geomorphological processes occurring in the massif during the late Holocene with respect to the climate variability prevailing in the Iberian Peninsula and neighbouring areas. According to lake sedimentary records, the 'Little Ice Age' has been the coldest period during the late Holocene. Historical sources suggest a temperature increase of 0.93 degrees C since the middle of the 19th century."

Gently dipping sandy silt layers, which display a low cohesive strength (C-0 = 7 kPa, mu = 34 degrees), favor the development of extensional detachments. A tectonic origin instead of a possible gravitational origin is supported by the perpendicularity between the paleoslope direction of the fluvial-deltaic environment inferred from imbricated pebbles, and the senses of movement deduced from fault slicken-lines. The link between high-angle normal faults (HANFs) - formed at different levels in the layered sequence-with horizontal fault segments comes to develop ramp-flat-ramp normal faults with associated roll-over in the hanging wall. Observed extensional duplexes are formed by parallel detachments connected through synthetic Riedel faults. These Riedel faults would produce the back-rotation of the individual blocks (horses), i.e., extensional folding of the originally subhorizontal layers. There is no correlation between the analyzed ramp-flat-ramp normal faults, accommodating south-southeastward extension during Serravallian-lower Tortonian, and either the regional Alpujarride/Nevado-Filabride west-directed extensional shear zone or the top-to-the-north detachments within Alpujarride units, which are clearly sealed by Serravallian-lower Tortonian sediments. Therefore, the studied normal faults are restricted to the brittle/ductile multilayer fluvio/deltaic sequence and accommodate moderate late extension instead of belonging to a large crustal extensional system connected with a regional detachment at depth. Therefore, the basin formed in a moderate crustal thickness context where small and medium-scale extensional systems were subordinate structures. These natural examples support the development of low-angle normal faults at very shallow crustal levels in multilayer sequences with suitable rheological conditions."

Satellite remote sensing is widely used to find out the evolution of the snow cover extension at medium-large scales. But these techniques pose some constraints if snow is heterogeneously distributed, as they do not correctly represent the physical processes that occur on a smaller scale than the satellite image. In such cases, terrestrial photographs, whose resolution can be more easily adapted to the required resolution for these study cases, are an economic and also efficient alternative. This work presents a methodology for the georeferencing and automatic detection of snow in terrestrial photography, as an alternative to the use of satellite images for the study of the snow cover evolution in small areas. This methodology has been evaluated during the snowmelt period in the spring of 2009 at a study site in Sierra Nevada Natural Park (Southern Spain). The resulting snow maps have been compared with the results available for that period obtained from the analyses of four Landsat images. The results show that the use of Landsat generally overestimated the extension of the snow cover in the study area."	"PT: S"	NA	"Neale,CMU Maltese,A."

Low-angle normal faults have been responsible for the exhumation of the metamorphic rocks constituting the Internal Zone or Alboran domain, as well as for the formation of sedimentary basins, commonly referred to as Betic intramontane basins. The Betic intramontane basins are located either on the Alboran domain or at the contact between the Alboran domain and the External Zone. All of these basins have a common sedimentary evolution, characterized by three main sequences separated by unconformities of regional significance. The lower (Upper Serravallian-Lower Tortonian) and upper sequences (uppermost Tortonian-Pleistocene) consist of continental clastic sedimentary rocks. The intermediate sequence (Upper-Tortonian-Upper Messinian) is made of marine sedimentary rocks, representing a very short-lived diachronic inundation, which lasted longer in the eastern and southern parts of the Betics. Subsidence rates in the basins reached maximum values during Late Serravallian-Early Tortonian times (13-7 Ma), and gradually decreased toward Pleistocene time. Uplift in the sierras surrounding the basins was roughly in accordance with the subsidence in the basins. The onset of subsidence of the Betic intramontane basins was coeval with the onset of extension in the deeper tectonometamorphic units of the Alboran domain, in Late Serravallian-Early Tortonian times. From latemost Tortonian on, the Africa-Europe convergence direction changed, giving way to E-W trending compressional folds, NW-SE oriented high-angle normal faults, as well as E-W and NE-SW trending strike-slip faults. These structures deformed the basins and their basements in a complex way, with coeval compression, exhumation and extension. Later on, strike-slip faults strongly affected some of the basin margins, obliterating the previous extensional structures. A lithosphere-scale scenario characterized by mantle delamination and/or subduction roll-back/slab-detachment provides the framework to explain the Betic intramontane basins."	"PT: B"	NA	"Busby,C.

The tension is accommodated mainly by NW-SE active normal faults, the most notable being the Baza Fault, in the Guadix-Baza Basin, and the Granada, Sierra Elvira-Dilar and Padul-Durcal Faults, in the Granada Basin. In addition, other active faults with different orientations also exist, such as the Alfahuara-Botardo and the Galera faults in the Guadix-Baza Basin, and the Huenes, Obeilar-Pinos Puente and N of Sierra Tejeda Faults in the Granada Basin. Moreover, in several sectors, the presence of orthogonal normal fault sets suggests alternating trends or even radial extension. Slip rates of these active faults, based on geologic markers, vary between 0.06 and 0.5 mm/year. Estimates for the maximum expected magnitude of earthquakes caused by these faults vary between M-W 6.0 and 7.0. The N of Sierra Tejeda and the Baza Faults, the largest faults in the Granada and Guadix-Baza Basins, respectively, have the greatest seismic potential. They could cause events up to a magnitude of M-W 6.5-7.0, although their reference earthquakes, computed for a return period of 475 years, are on the order of M-W 5.0-5.5."

However, methods of measurements of SSC, such as horns of ungulates, vary throughout the literature. Thus, the accuracy of horn growth measurements as proxies of true horn growth and the comparability of results inferred from different horn growth measurements may be questionable. We used the horns of Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica to compare horn growth measurements and to analyse reliability with true horn growth. Our results reveal that measurements used in previous studies differed substantially from true horn growth and volume estimated as a barrel appeared as the best proxy of annular segments of horns in the Iberian ibex. Horn growth measurements are not necessarily mutually comparable, just as classical measurements are not necessarily representative of true horn growth. We discuss the wider implications of these results and suggest that biological processes linked to horns of ungulates should be reappraised using improved and accurate measurements because horn growth pattern is a key factor in sustainable management and conservation plans of ungulate species around the world."

Our results revealed that nursing a kid does not seem detrimental to neatness in female Iberian ibex in terms of nonimmunological compatibility to contact-transmitted foreign bodies.

The food associated-effects of these factors for zooplankton growth were tested in field-laboratory experiments with the aim of separating the effects of food quantity from those of food quality at low food conditions, where there is good evidence to support the existence of food quality effects. Manipulation of nutrients generated a large food quantity gradient that exerted the strongest effect on zooplankton growth, with no significant role of UVR. Growth curves were fitted to a saturation function that reached a plateau at increasing seston levels of ca. 250, 500, and 1000 mu g C L-1 for the rotifer Keratella cochlearis, the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus, and the cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria, respectively, and after which growth decreased in M. laciniatus. Nutrients and to a lesser extent UVR also affected seston quality, which had a minor effect on zooplankton growth. K. cochlearis growth was strongly related to the P content of seston, whereas M. laciniatus and D. pulicaria growth were positively correlated with a P-normalized omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acid index (omega 3-PUFA:P). The increase in seston associated with more intense and frequent atmospheric depositions would adversely affect copepods, but improve growth of C-limited cladocerans and P-limited rotifers in pristine ecosystems of the Mediterranean region."

The needle terpene concentrations and emissions may play a key role in the defense of pines. We studied two subspecies of Pinus sylvestris, nevadensis (an endemic and relict subspecies) and iberica , with different levels of caterpillar attack in Sierra Nevada mountains (Spain). GC-MS analyses showed large total concentrations of terpenes (6 to 39 mg g(-1) of dry weight) in the needles of both subspecies under field conditions. Concentrations were 25 % higher in \"Non-Attacked Trees\" (NATs) of the iberica than in the nevadensis subspecies. The branches of NATs had terpene concentrations 20 % higher than those of \"Attacked Branches of attacked trees\" (ABs). Within attacked trees, the \"Non-Attacked Branches\" (NABs) also had terpene concentrations 20 % higher than those of ABs. Mainly alpha-pinene and germacrene D had higher concentrations in NATs and NABs than in ABs. Some terpenes had higher concentrations in NABs than in NATs, indicating possible systemic reactions. In subsp. nevadensis, the percentage of monoterpenes relative to total terpenes was higher in ABs than in other attack states. The rates of emission in nevadensis (standardized to 30 A degrees C) were ca. three times higher in ABs than in NABs and NATs. These results suggest that the lower terpene concentrations and high percentages of monoterpenes in ABs were produced by a combination of emission losses and terpene induction in response to herbivorous attack."

Ecologists and conservationists use radio-collars for different purposes: animal movement monitoring, home range, productivity, population estimation, behaviour, habitat use, survival, and predator-prey interaction, among others. The aim of our present study is to highlight the application of radio-collars for wildlife diseases monitoring. The spread of wildlife diseases and the efficacy of management actions for controlling them propose serious challenges for ecologists and conservationists, since it is difficult to re-capture (or simply observe) the same animal in pre-determined temporal interval, but such difficulty is overcome by the use of gps-gsm radio collars. Methods: In the present study we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the use of radio-collars in the monitoring of Iberian ibex affected by Sarcoptes scabiei in Sierra Nevada mountain range, Spain. Twenty-five moderate or slightly mangy animals were radio-collared between 2006 and 2013. Results: The radio-collars allowed us to confirm the presence of resistance to S. scabiei within Iberian ibex population. Twenty (80%) of the collared animals recovered totally from mange, while the disease progressed in the other five Iberian ibex (20% of the collared animals) and the animals died.

The mtDNA sequence from the newly discovered haplotype was compared with sequences from vole populations of the Sierra Nevada and Sierra Penalara mountain ranges (Spain) and from Churwalden (Switzerland). The nine recovered haplotypes clustered in four distinct lineages according to their geographical origin.

The evolutionary divergence between sequences from the Sierra Segura and other Spanish populations was higher than that among other Spanish haplotypes.

Studies on the diversity of Scarabaeinae in Colombia are available for certain biogeographic regions. However, some areas such as the Caribbean region are still poorly studied. In an attempt to fill this gap in the knowledge, a complete revision of fauna is presented based on the study of dung beetle species deposited in 16 national entomological collections and from literature records. A total of 90 species belonging to 24 genera in 6 tribes were found. Twenty species were newly recorded for La Guajira, 18 for Sucre, 11 for Magdalena, 9 for Bolivar, 9 for Cordoba, 3 for Atlantico and 2 for Cesar. The department with the highest richness is Magdalena, probably because it is the best sampled throughout its altitude gradient. When the species composition is analyzed, the Caribbean region presents scarce endemism except for the high lands of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The genus Onthophagus is the most diverse in the region; the species with the broadest altitude range is Ontherus sanctaemartae, found from 700 to 2500 m above sea level. The species composition of the Caribbean region is homogenous in the lowlands, showing a strong affinity with the biogeographic region of Choco. Four different altitude clusters were recognized: lowlands (0-500 m), high hills (>500-900 m), subandean-andean zone (>900 to 2500 m) and high mountains (>2500 m). An increase in the homogeneity is likely expected with further sampling. Finally, it is essential to intensify the sampling in this region, especially in the isolate mountain systems."

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between active tectonics and morphometric characteristics of alluvial fans around Danehkhoshk anticline in the Simply Folded Belt of Zagros. Morphometric characteristics of alluvial fans, such as area (FA), slope (SF) length of base (BF), width/length ratio (W/L), radius (R), sweep angle (SA) and entrenchment (E) as well as valley floor width-to-height ratio (Vf) and strata dips of anticline limbs (DAL), were measured. The study area was sub-divided into eight tectonic zones and then the mean values of the above-mentioned parameters were calculated in each zone. Result reveals that values of SA, BF and E are directly proportional to DAL The poor relationships between catchment characteristics (slope and area) and fan parameters are probably due to extensive karstic landforms of catchments having complex hydrologic systems and, hence, result in complex catchment/fan relations. The highly entrenched fans with high sweep angles and long bases are characteristic of tectonically active fronts of Danehkhoshk anticline, having V-shaped valleys (higher Vf values), steep triangular facets and more rotated limbs (higher DAL values). Apart from the tectonic control on fan development, the fan head entrenchment and negative accumulation spaces on most alluvial fans can be attributed to decreased sediment load and discharge the drier the present-day climate regime.

Additionally we studied their phytotoxic, antifungal and antiparasitic effects. The oils from cultivated A. absinthium were characterized by the presence of cis-epoxyocimene, chrysanthenol, and chrysanthenyl acetate. The variations observed in oil composition were mostly quantitative but also qualitative. (Z)-2,6-Dimethyl-5,7-octadien-2,3-diol has been isolated and identified by NMR. Among the oil samples, these rich in cis-epoxyocimene and sesquiterpenes were the most active ones against S. littoralis. (Z)-2,6-Dimethyl-5,7-octadien-2,3-diol showed moderate activity against S. littoralis. The strongest antifeedant effects were found for commercial A. absinthium oil samples rich in thujones and sabinyl acetate.

Alpine areas in the Mediterranean region are of special concern because of the high abundance of endemic species with narrow ranges. This study combined species distribution models, population structure analyses and Bayesian skyline plots to trace the past and future distribution and diversity of Linaria glacialis, an endangered narrow endemic species that inhabits summits of Sierra Nevada (Spain). The results showed that: (i) the habitat of this alpine-Mediterranean species in Sierra Nevada suffered little changes during glacial and interglacial stages of late Quaternary; (ii) climatic oscillations in the last millennium (Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age) moderately affected the demographic trends of L. glacialis; (iii) future warming conditions will cause severe range contractions; and (iv) genetic diversity will not diminish at the same pace as the distribution range. As a consequence of the low population structure of this species, genetic impoverishment in the alpine zones of Sierra Nevada should be limited during range contraction. We conclude that maintenance of large effective population sizes via high mutation rates and high levels of gene flow may promote the resilience of alpine plant species when confronted with global warming."

The study also examined the impact of Recovery Programmes implemented for the most endangered of these species. Analysis of historical Artemisia pollen-data series from 1992 to 2011 showed that flowering took place between late July and late September, but the trend towards higher summer temperatures detected over the series as a whole appeared to have delayed the start of flowering and brought forward the end of flowering, thus prompting a shortening of the season. A trend was also observed towards a delayed peak pollen period, together with a significant decline in the Annual Pollen Index, which was significantly influenced by rainfall over the months immediately prior to flowering. Recovery Programmes implemented for three species-Artemisia granatensis, A. alba subsp. nevadensis and A. umbelliformis-involved conservation measures including direct seeding and planting of seedlings. From the outset, these programmes led to a recovery of the Pollen Index, especially when using germinated seedlings, which adapted better than seeds to environmental conditions. In conclusion, pollen records proved to be a useful tool for assessing the status of endangered species."

Both the maternal and paternal genomes are expressed in somatic tissues, but the paternal genome is systematically excluded from the germ line, which is therefore purely maternal. Recently, a unique case of hybridogenesis at a social level was reported in the desert ant Cataglyphis hispanica. All workers are sexually produced hybridogens, whereas sexual forms (new queens and males) are produced by queens through parthenogenesis. Thus, only maternal genes are perpetuated across generations. Here, we show that such an unusual reproductive strategy also evolved in two other species of Cataglyphis belonging to the same phylogenetic group, Cataglyphis velox and Cataglyphis mauritanica. In both species, queens mate exclusively with males originating from a different genetic lineage than their own to produce hybrid workers, while they use parthenogenesis to produce the male and female reproductive castes. In contrast to single-queen colonies of C. hispanica, colonies of C. velox and C. mauritanica are headed by several queens. Most queens within colonies share the same multilocus genotype and never transmit their mates' alleles to the reproductive castes. Social hybridogenesis in the desert ants has direct consequences on the genetic variability of populations and on caste determination.

The method involves the extraction of 5.00 g of dry sample with methanol using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 2-Octylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt (20C(8)-LAS) was used as internal standard. The analytical methods were applied to marine sediments collected from the coast of Almeria (South-east Spain) and river sediments collected from the Monachil river (Granada, South-east Spain). For AS homologues, the found limits of detection were 0.04-0.08 mu g g(-1) for marine and river sediments. For AES ethoxymers, the found limits of detection were 0.03-0.09 mu g g(-1) and 0.06-0.22 mu g g(-1) for marine and river sediments, respectively. The highest concentrations of AS and AES were found in river sediment samples. Significant differences were also observed between the behavior of short-chain compounds (C-12) and long-chain compounds (C-14 to C-18). The influence of the physic-chemical properties of water on the occurrence of these compounds was also evaluated, and differences between long- and short-chain compounds were also observed. Additionally, principal components analyses were carried out in order to study the relationship between variables and to evaluate the sources of data variability and behavior patterns. Finally, important conclusions were drawn regarding the environmental behavior of AS and AES. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Short-term (2001-2008) changes in vascular plant species richness, cover and abundance were studied on four summits in the Sierra Nevada (Spain). The resurvey revealed a decrease in species richness on each summit, which is confirmed by small-scale changes in species abundance within the same summits. These changes involve local losses of high-elevation endemic species as well as the new appearance of predominantly more widespread species. Some of the latter species were also observed to expand elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada. On a small scale, cover of several endemic species decreased and cover of some species that occur on a wider altitudinal range increased. Although the observed changes are statistically only marginally or not significant, they are largely consistent with pan-European studies suggesting stagnant or declining species richness on summits of the Mediterranean biome and a 'thermophilisation' of the species composition in high mountain plant communities over the past years. Even though we cannot rule out other non-climatic factors, our results give rise to concern about the situation of the mainly endemic high-altitude flora of the Sierra Nevada and give an incentive to intensify monitoring efforts."

Here, a mathematical model that encompasses all monoclinic and triclinic transpressional deformations including triclinic deformation with inclined simple shear (phi) and/or inclined extrusion orientations (nu) can be tested using a step-by-step approach with available field evidence. Two cases are presented. The first case from the Wabigoon-Quetico boundary in the Archean Superior Province utilizes both fabric orientation and quantified strain data. The best fit of the field evidence to the model indicates that deformation likely took place along subvertical shear zones via transpression with subhorizontal simple shear (phi = 0-20 degrees) and variable inclined extrusion direction (extrusion can be either east or west and v typically indicates extrusion orientations between 0 and 50 degrees from vertical). The second case of the South Iberian shear zone has fabric orientation data, but no quantifiable strain possibilities. The best fit of the field evidence to the model indicates that deformation likely took place along a moderately inclined shear zone via transpression with subhorizontal simple shear (phi = 0-20 degrees) and variable inclined extrusion direction (nu values between 0 degrees and 80 degrees from the true dip of the shear zone). Using this protocol in other examples of natural deformation will allow further constraints to be applied to kinematic models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Episodes of forest decline occurred at 10.1, 9.2, 8.3, 7.4, 5.4-4.5 and 3.7-2.9 cal. ka BP, and between 1.9 cal. ka BP and the top of the record (1.3 cal. ka BP). Wavelet analysis confirms a similar to 900 yr periodicity prior to and during the early Holocene and the dominance of a similar to 1750 yr periodicity after 6 cal. ka BP. The similar to 900 yr periodicity has counterparts in numerous North Atlantic and Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records, and in solar irradiance proxies (Delta C-14 and Be-10), and may relate to a Sun-climate connection during the early Holocene. Comparisons between the MD95-2043 forest record and strategically located records from Morocco, Iceland, Norway and Israel suggest that the similar to 1750 yr mid- to late-Holocene oscillation reflects shifts between a prevailing strong and weak state of the zonal flow, with impacts similar to the positive and negative modes of the present-day North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The mid-to late-Holocene millennial oscillation in zonal flow appears closely coupled to North Atlantic surface ocean circulation dynamics, and may have been driven by an internal oscillation in deep-water convection strength. The findings suggest that the mid-Holocene transition in western Mediterranean climate was accompanied by a shift in the fundamental tempo of millennial-scale variability, reflecting contrasting sensitivity of the North Atlantic climate system to different forcing factors (solar versus oceanic) under deglacial and fully interglacial conditions."

A correct determination of natural lead levels is very important in order to evaluate anthropogenic lead contributions. In this paper, the anthropogenic signature of early metallurgy in Southern Iberia during the Holocene, more specifically during the Late Prehistory, was assessed by mean of a multiproxy approach: comparison of atmospheric lead pollution, fire regimes, deforestation, mass sediment transport, and archeological data. Although the onset of metallurgy in Southern Iberia is a matter of controversy, here we show the oldest lead pollution record from Western Europe in a continuous paleoenvironmental sequence, which suggests clear lead pollution caused by metallurgical activities since similar to 3900 cal BP (Early Bronze Age). This lead pollution was especially important during Late Bronze and Early Iron ages. At the same time, since similar to 4000 cal BP, an increase in fire activity is observed in this area, which is also coupled with deforestation and increased erosion rates. This study also shows that the lead pollution record locally reached near present-day values many times in the past, suggesting intensive use and manipulation of lead during those periods in this area.

These remains have been studied by means of environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with different detectors, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The red colour is caused by the presence of cinnabar (HgS) in the pores of the fossil bones and teeth, filling the dentinal and bone tubules and other cavities that at life were filled by organic matter. A nearby cinnabar outcrop in the metamorphic materials of Sierra Nevada is interpreted as the source of mercury.

We mapped six ecosystem services delivered by forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south-east Spain) from the supply- to the demand-sides, taking into account the influence of protected areas on the capacity of supply services. Semi-structured interviews and geographical information system sources were used to map the supply-side, whereas 205 face-to-face questionnaires were distributed to assess and map the demand-side. Our results show the existence of consistent ecosystem service bundles in terms of both the supply- and demand-sides, particularly between erosion control-recreational hunting and between mushroom harvesting-nature tourism. We found a spatial scale mismatch for the erosion control, with its supply at the local scale and its demand at the regional-national scales, with implications at the institutional scale at which it should be managed. Consequently, mapping both the supply- and demand-sides is essential for environmental decision making because it can indicate where management interventions should be focused, either by defining high-priority areas for protection or defining the institutional scale at which these services should be managed.

All these environmental protection programmers are a consequence of its unique landscape in the context of the mid-latitude semiarid mountains, with enclaves of exceptional scientific and cultural value. Thanks to its high altitude, Sierra Nevada held the southernmost Quaternary glaciers in Europe, as well as it happened during the Little Ice Age. In turn, Sierra Nevada is also singular thanks to its vast cultural heritage, since very early societies settled on its slopes and valleys and accommodate their lifestyles and economy to the characteristics of this mountain environment. Currently, Sierra Nevada has become an important tourist centre and receives a large amount of visitors. This process of change has conditioned the implementation of a different economic model: it brings benefits to the populations but it involves changes in the landscape as well, sometimes questionable. From this perspective, a critical revision of the legislation is required balancing the sustainable economic development of the population and the preservation and safeguarding of the heritage values of the landscape.

This input further attenuates the penetration of solar radiation, leading to the view that opaque lakes are more \"protected\" from solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than clear ones. Vertical mixing, however, complicates this view as cells are exposed to fluctuating radiation regimes, for which the effects have, in general, been neglected. Furthermore, the combined impacts of mixing, together with those of UVR and nutrient inputs are virtually unknown. In this study, we carried out complex in situ experiments in three high mountain lakes of Spain (Lake Enol in the National Park Picos de Europa, Asturias, and lakes Las Yeguas and La Caldera in the National Park Sierra Nevada, Granada), used as model ecosystems to evaluate the joint impact of these climate change variables. The main goal of this study was to address the question of how short-term pulses of nutrient inputs, together with vertical mixing and increased UVR fluxes modify the photosynthetic responses of phytoplankton. The experimentation consisted in all possible combinations of the following treatments: (a) solar radiation: UVR+ PAR (280-700 nm) versus PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) alone (400-700 nm); (b) nutrient addition (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)): ambient versus addition (P to reach to a final concentration of 30 mu g P L-1, and N to reach N: P molar ratio of 31); and (c) mixing: mixed (one rotation from surface to 3m depth (speed of 1 m 4 min(-1), total of 10 cycles)) versus static. Our findings suggest that under ambient nutrient conditions there is a synergistic effect between vertical mixing and UVR, increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic inhibition and excretion of organic carbon (EOC) from opaque lakes as compared to algae that received constant mean irradiance within the epilimnion. The opposite occurs in clear lakes where antagonistic effects were determined, with mixing partially counteracting the negative effects of UVR. Nutrient input, mimicking atmospheric pulses from Saharan dust, reversed this effect and clear lakes became more inhibited during mixing, while opaque lakes benefited from the fluctuating irradiance regime. These climate change related scenarios of nutrient input and increased mixing, would not only affect photosynthesis and production in lakes, but might also further influence the microbial loop and trophic interactions via enhanced EOC under fluctuating UVR exposure."

Species-specific vulnerability to drought mortality may alter patterns of species diversity and affect future forest composition. We have explored the consequences of the extreme drought of 2005, which caused high sapling mortality (approx. 50 %) among 10-year-old saplings of two coexisting pine species in the Mediterranean mountains of Sierra Nevada (Spain): boreo-alpine Pinus sylvestris and Mediterranean P. nigra. Sapling height growth, leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18, and foliar nitrogen concentration in the four most recent leaf cohorts were measured in dead and surviving saplings. The foliar isotopic composition of dead saplings (which reflects time-integrated leaf gas-exchange until mortality) displayed sharp increases in both delta C-13 and delta O-18 during the extreme drought of 2005, suggesting an important role of stomatal conductance (g(s)) reduction and diffusional limitations to photosynthesis in mortality. While P. nigra showed decreased growth in 2005 compared to the previous wetter year, P. sylvestris maintained similar growth levels in both years. Decreased growth, coupled with a sharper increase in foliar delta O-18 during extreme drought in dead saplings, indicate a more conservative water use strategy for P. nigra. The different physiological behavior of the two pine species in response to drought (further supported by data from surviving saplings) may have influenced 2005 mortality rates, which contributed to 2.4-fold greater survival for P. nigra over the lifespan of the saplings. This species-specific vulnerability to extreme drought could lead to changes in dominance and distribution of pine species in Mediterranean mountain forests."

We combined observational and experimental approaches aiming to determine the role played by the bush cricket Steropleurus andalusius as a regulator of T.pityocampa.

The predation rate of bush crickets reached 23%, varied in time and space, and was independent of T. pityocampa egg-batch density. There was no relationship between the egg-batch densities and bush cricket abundance, and no response to experimental variations in egg-batch density. Analysis of microhabitat selection suggests that T. pityocampa egg-batch predation is a by-product of the substrate selected by bush crickets for mating, and does not correspond with active searching of egg batches as food. These findings do not rule out the possibilty of bush crickets being natural regulators of T. pityocampa populations, although they impose limits with respect to their future use in biological control."

The PNFZ constitutes a major tectonic and lithological boundary in the Betics, and separates the metamorphic units of the Alpujdrride Complex from Upper Tertiary to Quaternary deposits. Due to recent seismicity and several morphological and geological indicators, such as preserved fault scarps, triangular facets, deeply incised valleys and faults in the colluvial wedges, the PNFZ is suspected to be a tectonically active feature of the south-eastern Granada Basin. We performed morphotectonic GIS analyses based on digital elevation models (DEM, cell size: 10 m) to obtain tectonic activity classes for each out-cropping segment of the PNFZ. We have determined the following geomorphic indices: mountain front sinuosity, stream-length gradient index, concavity index and valley floor width to height ratio. The results show a differentiation in the states of activity along the fault zone strike. The western and eastern segments of the PNFZ indicate a higher tectonic activity compared to the center of the fault zone. We discuss and critically examine the comparability and reproducibility of geomorphic analyses, concluding that careful interpretation is necessary, if no ground-truthing can be performed."

The proxies studied record an arid period from ca. 3800 to 3100 cal yr BP characterized by more xerophytic vegetation and lower lake levels. A humid period is recorded between ca. 3100 and 1850 cal yr BP, which occurred in two steps: (1) an increase in evergreen Quercus between 3100 and 2500 cal yr BP, indicating milder conditions than previously and (2) an increase in deciduous Quercus and higher lake levels, between ca. 2500 and 1850 cal yr BP, indicating a further increase in humidity and reduction in seasonal contrast. Humid maxima occurred during the Roman Humid Period, previously identified in other studies in the Mediterranean region. Intensified fire activity at this time could be related to an increase in fuel load and/or in human disturbance. An arid period subsequently occurred between 1850 and 650 cal yr BP, though a decrease in Quercus and an increase in xerophytes. The alternation of persistent North Atlantic Oscillation modes probably played an important role in controlling these humid-arid cycles. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Species classifications of AVIRIS and CASI hyperspectral imagery all approached 80% overall accuracy for the target bioindicator species. Remote sensing vegetation indices correlated best with longer-wavelength SWIR indices from the AVIRIS data in California, with the exception of the Photosynthetic Reflectance Index (PRI) correlation with the 011 Visual Component (OIIVI), which was also the highest direct correlation in Catalonia. In Catalonia, the OIIVI alone and its subparts correlated better with the CASI data than with the full OIL namely the PRI (R-2 = 0.28, p = 0.0044 for OIIVI-amount and R-2 = 0.33 and p = 0.0016 for OIIVI-severity). Stepwise regression models of ozone injury developed using remote sensing indices combined with terrain-derived GIS variables were significant for OII in California (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.0001) and in Catalonia (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001 for OIIVI). Multiple regression models of ozone injury including a three year average of O-3 exposure were significant both with imaging spectroscopy indices alone (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and with topographic variables added (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001) in Catalonia. Applying the multivariate models to image classifications could provide useful maps useful for ozone impact monitoring but requires further validation before being considered operational.

Still, only a few studies have been focused at a community level. Of particular interest are high mountain species, because of the high frequency of narrow endemics and their higher susceptibility to extinction due to the effects of climate change. In the present study we explored genome size variation and polyploidy incidence in the entomophilous plant communities of two distinct mountain ranges, the Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa National Parks. For that, chromosome numbers and DNA ploidies were assessed through a review of the literature, and the genome size and incidence of polyploidy in 39 taxa from several key genera were estimated using flow cytometry. In this study, first genome size estimations are given for 32 taxa. The majority of the analyzed taxa presented very small to small genome sizes (2C <= 7.0 pg), with no differences being detected between genome size and geographic origin and distribution ranges. A low incidence of polyploid taxa was observed (23.3%), with polyploids being more common in Picos de Europa than in Sierra Nevada. Most taxa inferred as polyploids were high altitude plants, but no clear pattern between polyploidy incidence and endemic status was observed. The obtained results are discussed within the context of angiosperm's genome size variation and of polyploidy incidence in alpine and arctic flora, contributing to the scientific knowledge of these natural communities of great biological importance."

However, few studies have addressed the effects of different burnt-wood management options on seedling/sapling performance, or the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying differences among treatments. In this study, we experimentally assess the effects of post-fire management of the burnt wood on the growth and performance of naturally regenerating pine seedlings (Pinus pinaster). Three post-fire management treatments varying in degree of intervention were implemented seven months after a high-severity wildfire burned Mediterranean pine forests in the Sierra Nevada, southeast Spain: (a) \"No Intervention\" (NI, all burnt trees left standing); (b) \"Partial Cut plus Lopping\" (PCL, felling most of the burnt trees, cutting off branches, and leaving all the biomass on site without mastication); and (c) \"Salvage Logging\" (SL, felling the burnt trees, piling up the logs and masticating the fine woody debris). Three years after the fire, the growth, foliar nutrient concentrations, and leaf carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta N-15) of naturally regenerating seedlings were measured in all the treatments. Pine seedlings showed greatest vigor and size in the PCL treatment, whereas growth was poorest in SL. The nutrient concentrations were similar among treatments, although greater growth in the two treatments with residual wood present indicated higher plant uptake. Seedlings in the SL treatment showed high leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18 values indicating severe water stress, in contrast to significantly alleviated water stress indications in the PCL treatment. Seedling growth and physiological performance in NI was intermediate between that of PCL and SL After six growing seasons, P. pinaster saplings in PCL showed greater growth and cone production than SL saplings. In summary, salvage logging has a detrimental effect on the ecophysiological performance and growth of naturally regenerating pine seedlings, compared to alternative post-fire management practices in which burnt logs and branches are left in situ. Improved seedling growth and performance is associated with the amelioration of microsite/microclimate conditions by the presence of residual burnt wood, which alleviates seedling drought stress and improves nutrient availability through the decomposition of woody debris.

Nest detection by brood parasites influences the probability of parasitism, and we propose that the difficulty faced by brood parasites of finding nests on the ground may make ground-nesting species subject to lower levels of parasitism, causing a reduction in levels of defence compared with species breeding in shrubs, trees and elsewhere above the ground. We tested the prediction that the rejection rate of Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus eggs by hosts is inversely related to the frequency with which they build nests on the ground, both at local and at continental scales. First, we used estimates of the rejection rate of non-mimetic model eggs experimentally introduced into the nests of 26 potential host species breeding in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of southern Spain. Most species tested in the Sierra Nevada showed high rejection rates of both mimetic and non-mimetic eggs, whereas the European Robin Erithacus rubecula, with a low rejection rate, was the only species that was regularly parasitized. At the continental scale we used all available published information on rejection rates of non-mimetic models by European hosts of the Common Cuckoo. The frequency of ground-nesting explained interspecific variation in rejection rate of non-mimetic model eggs both for the species tested in the Sierra Nevada and for all European hosts after controlling for all other life-history variables known to affect rejection rates. An effect of the abundance of trees in a particular habitat, previously shown to affect parasitism by the Common Cuckoo, was only apparent from analyses of continental-scale data and not from the Sierra Nevada mountains, suggesting that particular properties of mountainous areas affect Common Cuckoo parasitism. Ground-nesting species showed lower rejection rates than species breeding in bushes or trees. These results suggest that species nesting on the ground may have suffered lower parasitism pressures in their historical coevolutionary interactions with the Common Cuckoo."

The two fungi produced spores in pot cultures, using O. vulgatum, N. nevadensis, H. lanatus and T repens as bait plants. Acaulospora pustulata has a pustulate spore ornamentation similar to that of Diversispora pustulata, while A. tortuosa has surface projections that resemble innumerous hyphae-like structures that are more rudimentary than the hyphae-like structures known for spores of Sacculospora baltica or Glomus tortuosum. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of the ITS and partial LSU of the ribosomal genes reveal that both fungi are new species within the Acaulosporaceae. They are most closely related to A. alpina and undescribed Acaulospora species. With 45-72 lam spore size, Acaulospora pustulata is the smallest Acaulospora species known so far, while A. tortuosa has slightly larger spores (61-84(-94) mu m), which is in the range known for several other Acaulospora species like A. longula, A. alpina, A. nivalis and A. sieverdingii that have either smooth or pitted spore surfaces.

Recently, interest in this phenomenon has been revived, due to its potential contribution to elucidation of developmental mechanisms. Within insects, gynandromorphism includes several examples in Lepidoptera (mainly in the Macrolepidoptera). Yet, it is rare in the far less strikingly sexually dimorphic Microlepidoptera, mainly because it is harder to use external features to recognize gynandromorphs in this taxon. Here, we describe the first known case of gynandromorphism in Scythrididae, belonging to the genus Enolmis Duponchel, 1845. Enolmis species have light coloured external features, asymmetrical male genitalia, and developed henia in females. The different parts of male and female genitalia present in the Enolmis gynandromorph individual are described here."

In situ studies were carried out using sediment emergence traps and plankton sampling, and the sediment egg bank was analyzed. A laboratory experiment was performed to explore the role of photoperiod and temperature as hatching cues for D. pulicaria. We hypothesized that the time window for emergence would be short and that hatching cues would be linked to the variable ice-break period. In the field, D. pulicaria showed a highly synchronized emergence in both years. The hatching period was restricted to 3 weeks during and immediately after the thaw. In the laboratory experiment, no hatchings were observed in the dark treatment and neither photoperiod nor temperature affected hatching rates. Therefore, the presence of light, which corresponds with the period of ice-break, was essential for triggering dormancy termination of D. pulicaria. Our results show that the period when the ice-break occurs is a key event for Daphnia population development. The longer ice-free periods predicted by climate change in the alpine lakes could therefore have important effects on the crustacean population dynamics of these systems."

In semiarid areas, their particular climate conditions enhance the spatiotemporal variability of the snow albedo during the snow cover periods, increasing its difficulty in being measured and monitored. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for measuring snow albedo evolution. Ten years of Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 Thematic Mapper images were analysed to determine a trend in the albedo evolution throughout the year in a Mediterranean site, Sierra Nevada Mountain (Southern Spain). A pattern in snow albedo from all the snow pixel in each Landsat scene was obtained. It ranges from 0.8 in new snow to 0.4 in old dirty snow, with a decreasing rate of 0.003 albedo per day. This trend was validated with 5 specific location, where the snow is more persistent while the pixel remains well-illuminated."	"PT: S"	NA	"Neale,CMU Maltese,A."

Bryophyte species show wider distributions than vascular plants and include examples of truly cosmopolitan ranges, which have been interpreted as a result of high dispersal capacities and ecological plasticity. In the current study, we documented patterns of genetic structure and diversity in the cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum along an elevational gradient to determine if genetic diversity and structure is homogenized by intense migrations in the lack of ecological differentiation. Methods: 60 specimens were collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain) between 100 and 2870 m and sequenced for ITS and rps4. Comparative analyses, genetic diversity estimators, and Mantel's tests were employed to determine the relationship between genetic variation, elevation, and geographic distance and to look for signs of demographic shifts. Key results: Genetic diversity peaked above 1900 m and no signs of demographic shifts were detected at any elevation. There was a strong phylogenetic component in elevational variation. Genetic variation was signifi cantly correlated with elevation, but not with geographic distance. Conclusions: The results point to the long-term persistence of Bryum argenteum in a range that was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. Evidence for an environmentally driven pattern of genetic differentiation suggests adaptive divergence. This supports the Baas Becking tenet and indicates that ecological specialization might play a key role in explaining patterns of genetic structure in cosmopolitan mosses."

For its position and characteristics it is considered as an important \"sensor\" for global changes. Water samples were collected during the ice-free season in order to observe changes in the bacterial community structure. Experiments were carried out complementing culture and culture-independent methods. Strong variations of the bacterial communities were recorded along the sampling period in particular regarding number and phylogenetic relationships of the microorganisms detected. At the season beginning, bacterial counts were rather high but strains belonged only to beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. By contrast, in the middle of the season, possibly due to external inputs, total number of bacteria decreased but other phylogenetic groups, such as alpha-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicute appeared. On the whole, Proteobacteria were the dominant microbiota. Bacterial diversity and presence of most abundant species were analysed by PCR-TGGE. Sequencing of TGGE bands confirmed that prevalent Bacteria populations were evolutively close to Proteobacteria with predominance of alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. Analysis of diversity and functional organization suggested that \"La Caldera\" bacterial microbiota, typical of oligotrophic and/or extreme environments with low habitability, was characterized by a community organized in an adequate distribution of dominant and resilient species. Although rather specialized, the community presented a sufficient functionality and flexibility to react to changing and stressing conditions. However, along the ice-free season, the community evolved showing more specialized populations with less adaptation abilities.

Phase 2 of the Distributed Model lntercomparison Project (DMIP 2) was formulated primarily as a mechanism to help guide the U.S. NWS as it expands its use of spatially distributed watershed models for operational river, flash flood, and water resources forecasting. The overall purpose of DMIP 2 was to test many distributed models forced by high quality operational data with a view towards meeting NWS operational forecasting needs. At the same time, DMIP 2 was formulated as an experiment that could be leveraged by the broader scientific community as a platform for the testing, evaluation, and improvement of distributed models. DMIP 2 contained experiments in two regions: in the DMIP 1 Oklahoma basins, and second, in two basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the western USA. This paper presents the overview and results of the DMIP 2 experiments conducted for the two Sierra Nevada basins. Simulations from five independent groups from France, Italy, Spain and the USA were analyzed. Experiments included comparison of lumped and distributed model streamflow simulations generated with uncalibrated and calibrated parameters, and simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at interior locations. As in other phases of DMIP, the participant simulations were evaluated against observed hourly streamflow and SWE data and compared with simulations provided by the NWS operational lumped model. A wide range of statistical measures are used to evaluate model performance on a run-period and event basis. Differences between uncalibrated and calibrated model simulations are assessed. Results indicate that in the two study basins, no single model performed best,in all cases. In addition, no distributed model was able to consistently outperform the lumped Model benchmark. However, one or more distributed models were able to outperform the lumped model benchmark in many of the analyses. Several calibrated distributed models achieved higher correlation and lower bias than the calibrated lumped benchmark in the calibration, validation, and combined periods. Evaluating a number of specific precipitation-runoff events, one calibrated distributed model was able to perform at a level equal to or better than the calibrated lumped model benchmark in terms of event-averaged peak and runoff volume error. However, three distributed models were able to provide improved peak timing compared to the lumped benchmark. Taken together, calibrated distributed models provided specific improvements over the lumped benchmark in 24% of the model-basin pairs for peak flow, 12% of the model-basin pairs for event runoff volume, and 41% of the model-basin pairs for peak timing. Model calibration improved the performance statistics of nearly all models (lumped and distributed). Analysis of several precipitation/runoff events indicates that distributed models may more accurately model the dynamics of the rain/snow line (and resulting hydrologic conditions) compared to the lumped benchmark model. Analysis of SWE simulations shows that better results were achieved at higher elevation observation sites. Although the performance of distributed models was mixed compared to the lumped benchmark, all calibrated models performed well compared to results in the DMIP 2 Oklahoma basins in terms of run period correlation and %Bias, and event-averaged peak and runoff error. This finding is noteworthy considering that these Sierra Nevada basins have complications such as orographically-enhanced precipitation, snow accumulation and melt, rain on snow events, and highly variable topography. Looking at these findings and those from the previous DMIP experiments, it is clear that at this point in their evolution, distributed models have the potential to provide valuable information on specific flood events that could complement lumped model simulations.

The present study aimed to assess the conservation value of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. in stands subjected to two traditional rural practices, one specific (coppicing) and the other generic (maintenance of open parklands), and their effects on genetic diversity and clonal structure in this singular root sprouting oak at the southern limit of its distribution. Genetic diversity measures of seven nuclear simple sequence repeat markers were compared, and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibria were tested to be originated from recent population demography. Results showed that, regardless of forest structure, the degree of clonality was very similar (similar to 60 %), being allele and lineage density proportional to stem density. Nevertheless, evenness of clonal distribution was higher in coppice, suggesting more homogeneous management than in open woodland. Contrary to previous beliefs, coppice stands do not involve genetic diversity losses; rather, the process of forest conversion into open woodland leads to the removal of numerous genetic lineages and low frequency alleles. The ancient presence of Q. pyrenaica in the region, which constituted quaternary glacial refuge, may contribute to its high genetic diversity. Historical vicissitudes in this anthropogenic deforested territory remark its resilient character; based on a specific fire pre-adaptive trait, continued coppicing fostered the preservation of its natural genetic diversity. This study evidences the importance of the integration of molecular and historical approximations to assess the genetic and conservation status of a secularly profited woody species."

The comparison with Asian, European, and North American material of Dicranoweisia intermedia proved the conspecifity of both taxa, which was corroborated by molecular data. Therefore, the distribution area of H. mulahaceni is extended to U.S.A., Canada, Greenland, and several Asian countries (Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). We also tested the monophyly of Hymenoloma sensu Ochyra et al. (2003), by including in the analysis the Holarctic taxa assigned to the genus together with Chilean material identified as H. antarcticum (putatively synonymous with the type of Hymenoloma) and H. crispulum. Phylogenetic analysis of basal haplolepidous taxa taking into account different genera, mainly of the Dicranales but also of Bryoxiphiales and Scouleriales, confirmed the monophyly of Hymenoloma and suggested a close relationship with the Scouleriaceae sensu Hedderson et aL (2004), while Dicranoweisia was resolved within Rhabdoweisiaceae. Molecular data helped us to show that Hymenoloma brevipes, morphologically closely related to H. crispulum, is a distinct taxon from H. antarcticum. This challenges the earlier records of H. crispulum from the Southern Hemisphere but a comprehensive revision is necessary to confirm its status in the region. A key to the genera Dicranoweisia and Hymenoloma and the European species of Hymenoloma is included."

In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Averaging soil nutrient values and eliminating outliers from data sets can obscure important information about the nature and frequency of such hot spots. In this study, soil nutrient hot spots were investigated by sampling forest soils using resin-based methods to capture the effects of leaching and preferential flow followed by destructive O horizon and soil sampling including both nutrient and microbial analyses. Six by six-meter grids (16 grid points at 2-m intervals) were instrumented with UniBest (R) resin capsules and Western Ag Innovations PRS (TM) probes in sets of four per grid point at two sites. After the first precipitation event in the fall, two capsules and two probes were removed (referred to as \"event samples\"), and the remaining two were left in place for the entire winter season and then removed in the following summer (referred to as \"season samples\"). We hypothesized that hot spots (as indicated by statistical outliers and significant positive skew) would be more prevalent in the event samples than in the season samples because of greater importance of preferential flow during the first event. Data for the resin capsules supported this hypothesis, whereas data for the PRS probes did not. Calcium and Mg2+ values for season samples were significantly greater than those for event samples for both capsules and probes at both sites, as was expected because of the greater exposure to leaching in the season samples. Differences in event and season values for orthophosphate, NO3-, NH4+, and K+ varied, however, with some showing season > event, some no significant difference, and some event > season, suggesting a greater role of biological uptake in spring and perhaps the effect of cation exchange on resins. After the removal of the season resin samples, cores of O horizons and surface mineral soils were taken at each grid point and analyzed for total C and N, water-extractable nutrients, and microbial biomass (the latter in the mineral soil only by phospholipid fatty acid analysis). Correlations with microbial biomass measured via phospholipid fatty acid analysis were inconsistent. In summary, we found no consistent pattern of hot spots with season of sampling or microbial biomass. The seasonality of resin-based measurements suggested that ions of N and P were released mostly during the first precipitation event, whereas the reverse was true for Ca and Mg."

High mountains are extreme habitats which, because of their marked temperature decrease with altitude, impose difficulties for reptile thermoregulation, as the number of optimum-temperature days diminish in altitude. We studied the activity patterns of the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which has a wide altitudinal distribution, at six sampling stations that spanned an altitudinal range from 300 to 2500 m asl in Sierra Nevada (SE Iberian Peninsula). We performed censuses of the species during the seasonal and daily activity period, and measured lizard body temperature and environmental temperature in the six sampling plots along the altitude gradient. The body temperature of the lizards remained closely the same even though environmental temperature decreased around 9 C along that gradient. Seasonal activity peaked at the beginning of the activity period in highlands, but in the middle of the season in middle and lowland regions. However, newborns appeared in the field almost at the same time along the altitude gradient. We suggest that the thermoregulatory strategies of the lizards must vary along this altitudinal gradient, permitting lizards to keep their body temperature close to a very similar optimum and thus, develop very similar circa-annual activity patterns.

The fisher (Pekania pennanti), a mesopredator that occurs in mid-elevation forests of the southern Sierra Nevada, is such a species and managers are challenged to address fuel accumulations while at the same time maintaining sufficient habitat. We were interested in whether fishers tolerate the amount of management-related disturbance that fire ecologists predict will be sufficient to reduce the severity and spread rate of fires. To address this question we related an index of relative fisher abundance to data on the amount of each sample area that has been affected by one or more forms of disturbance. These are forms of forest management associated with either restoration activities (e.g., thinning, prescribed fire) or timber harvest (e.g., clear cutting, selection harvest). We used scat detection dogs to determine the relative abundance of scats in each of 15, 14 km(2) hexagonal sample areas that were sampled twice a year for 4 years. These data were used to classify each sample area as either low, moderate or high relative abundance of fishers. We also summarized for each of the sample areas the total number of hectares (including overlap) affected by management activities each year, and generated a 3-year running average. The areas exhibiting the highest use by fishers had an average of 36.7 hectares per year affected by ground-disturbing activities. Given that each sample area was 1400 hectares, this suggests that fishers consistently occupy at the highest rate of use places where an average of 2.6% of the area has been disturbed per year. This translates to an average of 7.4 ha of disturbance/year/km(2) (47.1 acres of disturbance/year/mi(2)). This is more disturbance than was predicted to be necessary to treat forests to reduce fire spread rate and severity in the southern Sierra Nevada, but less than predicted to be necessary by fire models for other geographic locations. Our work suggests that it may be possible to implement restorative treatments at an extent and rate that achieves fire modeling goals and does not affect occupancy by fishers. Implementation of such an approach, however, should also consider protection of large trees (conifers and hardwoods) used as resting and denning sites and account for the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

High mountain freshwater presents high variability of nutrients and chemico-physical parameters, showing variations of pH, oxygen concentration, metals and temperature throughout the year. National Park of Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) (37 degrees 032 N 03 degrees 182 W), has almost 40 lakes that are reported to be both endemic and oligotrophic. However, very little information about their microbial diversity can be found in literature. In this work, a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to find best nutritional conditions for the isolation of psychrophilic microalgae from La Caldera Lake. The results showed that best culture medium, was the Rodriguez-Lopez medium. (RL); data were adjusted to a quadratic prediction model reporting a biomass concentration over 600 mg/L at 10 and 20 degrees C. In this paper, the diversity of culturable freshwater microalgae in the La Caldera Lake was observed by PCR using specific primers for eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes. Samples were taken in early July and late Agust, 2011. In July presence of strains belonging to the Eustigmatophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. In August, only microalgae from the Eustigmatophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. An individual culture of each isolated strain was carried out. Microalgae S21 had phylogenetic similitude with Chlorophyceae, and showed best growth being biomass concentration in RL 393.73 mg/L and 128.52 mg/L at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, respectively.

The Lateglacial and early Holocene periods are characterized by arid conditions with a stable landscape dominated by pinewoods and steppe until ca. 7780 cal yr BP, despite sedimentological evidence for large paleohydrological fluctuations in the paleolake. The most humid phase occurred between ca. 7780 and 5000 cal yr BP and was characterized by the maximum spread of mesophytes (e.g., Betula, Coorlus, Quercus faginea type), the expansion of a mixed Mediterranean oak woodland with evergreen Quercus as dominant forest communities and more frequent higher lake level periods. The return of a dense pinewood synchronous with the depletion of mesophytes characterizes the mid-late Holocene transition (ca. 5000 cal yr BP) most likely as a consequence of an increasing aridity that coincides with the reappearance of a shallow, carbonate wetland environment. The paleohydrological and vegetation evolution shows similarities with other continental Mediterranean areas of Iberia and demonstrates a marked resilience of terrestrial vegetation and gradual responses to millennialscale climate fluctuations. Human impact is negligible until the lbero-Roman period (ca. 2500 cal yr BP) when a major deforestation occurred in the nearby pine forest. The last 1500 years are characterized by increasing landscape management, mainly associated with grazing practices shaping the current landscape. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

To date, both the diagnosis of oestrosis and the determination of the intensity of parasitism require the use of invasive methods (necropsy), which necessarily limit research possibilities. We analyzed the immune humoral response (IgM and IgG) against Oestrus ovis L. excretory/secretory larval antigens in 32 sera taken from Iberian ibex from the Sierra Nevada Natural Space (southern Spain). Three antigens were collected: L1OES (from L1 larvae), L2OES (L2), and L3OES (L3). Necropsy was considered as the gold standard. The percentage of ibexes harboring Oestrus spp. larvae was 88%, the mean intensity of parasitism being 16.96 +/- 14.96 larvae per parasitized host (range: 2-52). In our sample, first-instar larvae (L1) were found in 9% of ibexes, while 69% of hosts carried L2 larvae and 88% L3 larvae. Positive correlations between L1 and L2 numbers, and between L2 and L3 numbers were detected. The best results with the immunoenzymatic assay were obtained using IgG antibodies against the L1OES antigens (specificity = 89%; sensitivity = 100%; positive predictive value = 100%; negative predictive value = 57%). The IgG seroprevalence against L1OES was 78%. Thus, the analysis of IgG antibodies against antigens collected from L1 O. ovis larvae would seem to be a noninvasive method for reliably diagnosing oestrosis in naturally infested Iberian ibex. Nevertheless, additional immunological and methodological advances are still required because false positive and false negative results still represent a non-negligible part of the results of the ELISA tests."

The cryptodomes are crisscrossed by a series of fractures and veins infilled with brecciated material, the clasts of which often show well-preserved jigsaw textures, as well as evidence of fluidal and sub-planar margins. Surrounding the breccia clasts were three different matrix types, namely a red floatstone/rudstone containing fossils (predominantly solitary corals), as well as pink and orange mudstones. Together, these lithologies are interpreted as resulting from in-situ peperitisation at the top of the cryptodomes and related mass flows, generated as a result of volcanic activity in a submarine setting. The evolution of the succession can be explained in terms of a two-stage model. Stage 1 (pre-Carboneras volcanic stage) comprised the deposition of calcarenites, often interbedded with volcaniclastics and possible bentonites. The volcanic products were derived from the S, SE and E, although it is possible that some of the material was also derived from areas to the N of the Carboneras region. Stage 2 (Carboneras volcanic stage) was characterised by volcanic activity forming massive andesites, and the related intrusion of the andesites into wet and/or unconsolidated carbonate sediments resulting in peperite development. In the Carboneras area mass flows were generated and flowed southwards into the Agua Amarga Basin."

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to design and implement a web application that will help to meet this challenge. This tool will foster cooperation among scientists, enhancing the creation of relevant knowledge that could be transferred to environmental managers. We have implemented this conceptual framework in a tool called ModeleR. This is being used to document, share, and execute more than 200 models and analytical processes associated with a global change monitoring program that is being undertaken in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south Spain). ModeleR uses the concept of scientific workflow to connect and execute different types of models and analytical processes. Finally, we have envisioned the creation of a federation of model repositories where models documented within a local repository could be linked and even executed by other researchers.

We present a multi wavelength study of the Be/X-ray binary system SAX J2103.5+4545 with the goal of better characterizing the transient behaviour of this source. Methods. SAXJ2103.5+4545 was observed by Swift/XRT four times in 2007 from April 25 to May 5, and during quiescence in 2012 August 31. In addition, this source has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife. Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain), and Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) since 2011 August, and from the TOM-TAR National Observatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2009 June. We performed spectral and photometric temporal analyses to investigate the different states exhibited by SAXJ2103.5+4545. Results. In X-rays, an absorbed power-law model provided the best fit for all the XRT spectra. An iron-line feature at similar to 6.42 key was present in all the observations except for that taken during quiescence in 2012. The photon indexes are consistent with previous studies of SAX J2103.5+4545 in high/low-luminosity states, Pulsations were found in all the XRT data from 2007 (2.839(2) mHz; MJD 54 222.02), but not during quiescence. The two optical outbursts in 2010 and 2012 lasted for about eight or nine months (as the one in 2007 probably did and the current one in 2014 might do) and were most probably caused by mass-ejection events from the Be star that eventually fed the circumstellar disc. All of these outbursts started about three months before the triggering of the X-ray activity and at about the same period before the maximum of the Ho line equivalent width (in emission) was reached at only similar to 8-5 angstrom. The global correlation between the BV variability and the X-ray intensity was also observed at longer wavelengths in the IR domain."

In this study, we identified hotspots at two scales of analysis within the Mediterranean overall hotspot. Particularly, based on the distribution of endemic-vascular-plant richness (EVPR), we identified micro-hotspots, among the richest floristic territories of the Sardinian and Baetic regions, and nano-hotspots, among the richest 1-km(2) grid cells of Sierra Nevada and Gennargentu massifs, located within these regions. In addition, we explored environmental drivers of EVPR, performing both simple- and multiple-regression models. Our results showed that even in areas previously defined as hotspots, the endemic-plant richness was not uniformly distributed, but rather depended largely on environmental conditions. Relationships between environmental drivers and EVPR have been poorly studied in the Mediterranean context, where we found patterns consistent among scales and regions. Specifically, EVPR was positively linked to altitude and precipitation, particularly in the driest period. Hence, the different levels of hotspots nested in hotspots were organized in a hierarchy. This downscaling approach may help to focus conservation efforts within a given hotspot, e.g. the identification of narrow hotspots could be useful to find gaps in the protected-area networks. Specifically, the identified nano-hotspots are certainly priority sites for plant conservation, since the whole of the nano-hotspots in each region represented less than 1% of the surface area but contained more than 19% of the regional EVPR. Moreover, an examination of both where hotspots are and under what environmental conditions they appear, would enable the detection of specific threats. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In addition, our understanding of the effects of the ambient water mass and the way in which erupting magma and water interact, and the ways in which the physical properties of the water mass control and influence eruption styles, dispersal processes and deposit characteristics, is still at a relatively early stage. In particular, in the past there has been a very simplistic approach to assessing constraints on eruption styles using only ambient hydrostatic pressure, whereas equally important properties such as bulk modulus, compressibility, deformability, attenuation properties, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, have not been adequately considered. This review summarises our understanding on these issues, and briefly summarises varying eruption conditions, styles and deposit characteristics. The origin of pumice deposits preserved in subaqueous settings needs to be interpreted with care. They could represent local explosive events, but could also represent pumice sourced from distant explosive events and vents, even subaerial, and deposited by fallout through water, the passage of pyroclastic flows into water from subaerial vents, long distance rafting of buoyant pumice by currents, reworking and resedimentation, and even non-explosive subaqueous vesiculation and quench fragmentation of subaqueously erupted lavas in shallow or even deep water. The Miocene Cabo de Gata volcanic succession of southeastern Spain was deposited in shallow marine environments based on interbedded fossiliferous limestones, which represent periods of volcanic hiatus. The volcanic facies are consistent with a shallow marine setting, involving eruption of low volatile bearing magmas to form andesite and dacite lava flows, domes and associated hyaloclastites, as well as eruptions of volatile rich rhyolitic magmas that produced pumice deposits erupted from subaerial vents or vents at water depths that were too shallow to suppress explosive eruptions through the effects of hydrostatic pressure, but were then reworked and resedimented."

In the present.study, a collection of strains nodulating this legume was analysed in characteristic soils of this ecosystem. Most strains nodulating G. versicolor belonged to rrs group I within the genus Bradyrhizobium and only one strain, named GV137, belonged to rrs group II from which only a single species, B. retamae, has been described in Europe to date. Strain GV137, and some strains from rrs group I, belonged to putative new species of Bradyrhizobium, although most strains from group I belonged to B. canariense, according to the ITS fragment and atpD gene analysis. This result contrasted with those obtained in Genista tinctoria in Northeast Europe whose endosymbionts were identified as B. japonicum. The analysis of the symbiotic nodC and nifH genes carried by G. versicolor-nodulating strains showed that most of them belonged to symbiovar genistearum, as did those isolated from G. tinctoria. Nevertheless, strain GV137, belonging to rrs group II, formed a divergent lineage that constituted a novel symbiovar within the genus Bradyrhizobium for which the name sierranevadense is proposed. This finding showed that the Genisteae are not restrictive legumes only nodulated by symbiovar genistearum, since Genista is a promiscuous legume nodulated by at least two symbiovars of Bradyrhizobium, as occurs in Retama species.

Between 1991 and 2012, different geomatic techniques - total station, global positioning system, close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanner - were applied to monitor the movement of cryosphere landforms in the high mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. The applied techniques must be adapted to the dynamic conditions of cryospheric environments, and so there is no ideal general technique, and depending on the characteristics of the geomorphological structure to be studied, different geomatic techniques can be used. However, there are situations in which certain instruments cannot be used: global positioning system-real time kinematics shows difficulties when the presence of vertical walls cause a multipath' effect. The technique that provides the best results in each case must be chosen, although they can all give good results in measuring and monitoring geomorphological processes. This paper analyses the techniques used and results on vertical and horizontal changes of glaciers, rock glaciers and ice patches in the Sierra Nevada, Pyrenees and Picos de Europa, and differences among them by location and topoclimatic setting. All glaciers and rock glaciers show a thinning tendency and annual variations in the flow velocity. In addition to the specific dynamic analysis, the geomatic techniques can be used to detail scale and volume changes and perimeter of the analysed landforms."

The need to protect the soil requires a rapid restoration of vegetation, which is often done with commercial seed mixtures that can cause a negative impact on these high mountain ecosystems. Thus, the use of seeds of native species is essential, especially in areas rich in endemic species. The compaction of snow as a result of the preparation of the ski slopes causes the soil to freeze. This hinders the germination of seeds, especially those of shrub species. This paper analyzes, under laboratory conditions, how freezing and phytohormone application affect the seed germination of three endemic shrubby species used in the restoration of the ski slopes on Sierra Nevada (S. Spain). Freezing considerably reduced the germination of all species. However, when seeds were previously subjected to phytohormones, the germination percentage increased up to 10-fold with respect to seeds not treated with growth regulators. The results suggest that treating seeds with phytohormones could improve the restoration of the ski slopes with native species."

Associated high-altitude streams will face significant hydrological changes that might affect population genetic diversity of lotic species. In a recent study of glacier-fed streams in the Pyrenees, Finn et al. (2013) predicted that a large proportion of regional genetic diversity of the mayfly Baetis alpinus would be lost as glacial meltwater sources disappear. We expanded the analysis of Finn et al. to include genetic data (mitochondrial barcoding region) collected from B. alpinus occupying recently deglaciated locations including multiple basins in 2 mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa) on the Iberian Peninsula and 1 additional, deglaciated Pyrenean basin. We hypothesized that regional genetic diversity at scales of entire mountain ranges (gamma diversity) and population structure within ranges (beta diversity) would be lower in recently deglaciated mountain ranges than in the still-glaciated Pyrenees. For 4 cryptic lineages of the B. alpinus species complex in 3 mountain ranges, we found significantly lower genetic diversity in recently deglaciated than glaciated regions. beta and gamma genetic diversity were correlated, suggesting that population structure (beta) strongly influences total regional diversity. Results support the hypothesis of Finn et al. (2013) that disappearance of alpine glaciers will result in substantial loss of genetic diversity. The distinctive hydrological environment created by glacial meltwater might drive an interaction between reproductive barriers (between highly and minimally glacier-influenced reaches within basins) and physical barriers (isolating highly glacier-influenced reaches"	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"2161-9549"	NA	"[Finn, Debra S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

Based on geomorphological mapping, cosmogenic exposure dating and previous studies of lacustrine sediment cores, the different deposits were dated and a sequence of geomorphological and paleoenvironmental events was established as follows: (1) The Marbore Cirque was at least partially deglaciated before 12.7kyrBP. (2) Some ice masses are likely to have persisted in the Early Holocene, although their moraines were destroyed by the advance of glaciers during the Mid Holocene and LIA'. (3) A glacial expansion occurred during the Mid Holocene (5.1 +/- 0.1kyr), represented by a large push moraine that enclosed a unique ice mass at the foot of the Monte Perdido Massif. (4) A melting phase occurred at approximately 3.4 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.1kyr (Bronze/Iron Ages) after one of the most important glacial advances of the Neoglacial period. (5) Another glacial expansion occurred during the Dark Age Cold Period (1.4-1.2kyr), followed by a melting period during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. (6) The LIA' represented a clear stage of glacial expansion within the Marbore Cirque. Two different pulses of glaciation were detected, separated by a short retraction. The first pulse occurred most likely during the late 17th century or early 18th century (Maunder Minimum), whereas the second occurred between 1790 and ad1830 (Dalton Minimum). A strong deglaciation process has affected the Marbore Cirque glaciers since the middle of the 19th century. (7) A large rock avalanche occurred during the Mid Holocene, leaving a chaotic deposit that was previously considered to be a Late Glacial moraine."

The first one is a semi-automatic 3D photo-reconstruction method (SA-3D-PR) based on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform algorithm and the epipolar geometry theory that uses oblique photographs and camera calibration parameters as input. The second method is fully automatic (FA-3D-PR) and is based on the recently released software 123D-Catch that uses the Structure from Motion and MultiView Stereo algorithms and needs as input oblique photographs and some measurements in order to scale and geo-reference the resulting model. The accuracy of the models was tested using as benchmark a 3D model registered by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The results indicate that both methods can be applied to micro-scale study of rock glacier morphologies and processes with average distances to the TLS point cloud of 0.28 m and 0.21 m, for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. The performance of the models was also tested by means of the dimensionless relative precision ratio parameter resulting in figures of 1:1071 and 1:1429 for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. Finally, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area were produced and compared with the TLS-derived DEM.

This cirque was the source of a glacier valley during the Quaternary cold periods. During the Little Ice Age it sheltered a small glacier, the most southerly in Europe, about which we have possessed written records since the 17th century. This glacier still had ice residues until the mid-20th century. This ice is no longer visible, but a residue persists along with discontinuous permafrost trapped under strata of rock blocks that make up an incipient rock glacier. From 2006 to 2013, this rock glacier was monitored by measurement of the temperature of the active layer, the degree of snow cover on the ground, movements of the body of the rock glacier and geophysical prospection inside it. The results show that the relict ice and trapped permafrost have been steadily declining. The processes that explain this degradation occur in chain, starting from the external radiation that affects the ground in summer, which is when the temperatures are higher. In effect, when this radiation steadily melts the snow on the ground, the thermal expansive wave advances into the heart of the active layer, reaching the ceiling of the frozen mass, which it then degrades and melts. In this entire linked process, the circulation of meltwaters ful-fils a highly significant function, as they act as heat transmitters. The complementary nature of these processes explains the subsidence and continuous changes in the entire clastic pack and the melting of the frozen ceiling on which it rests. This happens in summer in just a few weeks. All these events, in particular the geomorphological ones, take place on the Sierra Nevada peaks within certain climate conditions that are at present unfavourable to the maintenance of snow on the ground in summer. These conditions could be related to recent variations in the climate, starting in the mid-19th century and most markedly since the second half of the 20th century. The work and results highlight the climate sensitivity of the peaks of the Sierra Nevada to the effect of climate change and its impact on the dynamics of ecosystems, which is a benchmark for evaluating the current evolution of landscapes of Mediterranean high mountains."

This information is highly relevant to human well-being, which is the motivation of ecosystem services assessments. We present results from an analysis of stakeholders' perceptions of ecosystem services, well-being and drivers of change in two semi-arid watersheds in south-eastern Spain. Based on the information compiled through a literature review, participant observation and semi-structured interviews, we designed a questionnaire and conducted 381 interviews. Our results show that semiarid watersheds deliver a large variety of ecosystem services; however, these services are perceived in different ways. We identified five stakeholder groups, including: locals dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, locals not directly dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, environmental and local development professionals and rural and nature tourists. Overall, provisioning services related to traditional practices were perceived as highly important and highly vulnerable by every stakeholder group. However, we found contrasting perceptions of some ecosystem services among stakeholders and of the relevant drivers of change and wellbeing. We suggest that socio-cultural valuation is a useful tool to prioritize ecosystem services but more attention should be directed to emerging trade-offs. Linking values to other stakeholder perceptions might be a useful way to move forward in ecosystem services valuation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Previous Saharan dust input reconstructions have been mainly based on marine records from the African margin, nevertheless dust reaching western-central Europe is mainly transported by high-altitude atmospheric currents and requires high altitude records for its reconstruction. The organic and inorganic geochemical study of sediments from a southern Iberia alpine lacustrine record has provided an exceptional reconstruction of Saharan dust impact and regional climatic variations during the Holocene. After the last deglaciation, results indicate that Saharan dust reached Western Europe in a stepwise fashion from 7.0 to 6.0 cal. kyr BP and increased since then until present, promoting major geochemical changes in the lacustrine system. Effective humidity reconstruction indicates wetter conditions during the early Holocene and progressive aridification during middle-late Holocene time, boosting abrupt changes in the lacustrine system. Cyclostratigraphic analyses and transport mechanisms both point to solar irradiance and aridity as major triggering factors for dust supply over Western Europe during the Holocene.

We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity, cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of intervention: \"Non-Intervention\" (all trees left standing), \"Partial Cut plus Lopping\" (felling 90% of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and \"Salvage Logging\" (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species assemblages and 25% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities. Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species, which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

Basal area increment (BAI) was measured in severely defoliated and non-defoliated trees, for a period of 20 years, a period that includes three severe droughts and two severe outbreaks of pine processionary moth. Linear mixed-effects models of BAI as a function of climate were run for non-defoliated trees and thereafter the fit of the model was tested separately both for defoliated and non-defoliated ones. Severely defoliated trees showed pronounced growth reductions during defoliation, although their cumulative basal area and drought-sensitivity were similar to those of non-defoliated trees. The results were not related to tree size or age, while non-climatic residuals were significantly related to the defoliation percentage. The combined effect of drought stress and processionary caterpillar defoliation caused short-term growth reduction in affected trees, although defoliated trees presented higher growth recovery after the defoliation, displaying similar average growth. We conclude that, in Scots pine, the growth reduction induced by processionary caterpillar defoliation can be overcome to a greater extent than the impact of drought. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, the assessment of the solar energy resources over large areas and the elaboration of solar radiation maps are conducted using satellite derived information. Among the existing methodologies, those based on parametric models to firstly estimate the clear-sky solar radiation are usual. The success of that option depends both on the accuracy of the solar radiation algorithm and the satellite derived information and on the relationship between each other. In this work, daily global solar irradiation under clear skies is estimated by means of a model which includes the horizon effects. This characteristic is important in those cases where a complex topography is present, such as mountains. The topographic information is obtained from a digital elevation model. The other inputs to the model are the atmospheric precipitable water vapour content, the Angstrm's turbidity coefficient and the ground albedo. Experimental values of the atmospheric precipitable water vapour content are obtained from the MODIS sensor. The two latter parameters are averaged values calculated on previous studies. Estimates by the model are compared with ground measurements obtained in fourteen radiometric stations located in a mountain zone (Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain) recording global solar radiation, atmospheric temperature and relative humidity.

This study assesses the distribution of four native riparian plants along the riverbank topographic gradient in three river stretches in southern Spain, with special emphasis on the occupation of adult and young feet of each species. The studied stretches suffered minimal human disturbances, displayed semi-arid conditions, and had wide riparian areas to allow the development of the target species: black alder (Alnus glutinosa), salvia leaf willow (Salix salviifolia), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and oleander (Nerium oleander). Thalweg height was used to define the riverbank topographic gradient. The results showed a preferential zone for black alder and salvia leaf willow in the range of 0-150 cm from the channel thalweg, with adult alders and willows being more common between 51 and 150 cm and young alders being more common under 50 cm. Conversely, narrow-leafed ash and oleander were much more frequent, and showed greater development, in the ranges of 151-200 cm and 201-250 cm, respectively, whereas the young feet of both species covered the entire topographic range. Adult feet of the four species were spatially segregated along the riverbank topographic gradient, indicating their differential ability to cope with water stress from the non-tolerant alders and willows to more tolerant narrow-leafed ash trees and oleanders. Young feet, however, showed a strategy more closely linked to the initial availability of colonisation sites within riparian areas to the dispersion strategy of each species and to the distribution of adult feet. In Mediterranean areas, where riparian management has traditionally faced great challenges, the incorporation of species preferences along riverbank gradients could improve the performance of restoration projects."

We recorded the number of eggs per ephippium collected in the traps and studied the zooplankton and phytoplankton communities as well as the nutrient conditions in the lake. Ephippia production was negatively correlated with the light phase of the photoperiod. Numerous empty ephippia were produced, and their number was negatively correlated with the epibiont burden of the chlorophyte Korshikoviella gracilipes on Daphnia. The number of healthy eggs per ephippium in the sediment traps was related to the edible phytoplankton biomass and/or epibiont burden. The proportion of empty ephippia was negatively related to the epibiont burden. These results suggest that the onset and rate of ephippia production is related to the photoperiod, and that the production of ephippial eggs per ephippium increases with greater food availability (phytoplankton biomass and/or epibiont burden). This is the first published evidence that food availability may favour resting egg reproduction under photoperiod conditions that trigger ephippia production."

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits. Results We found up-slope range shifts for 63% and 90% of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts were consistent with the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the biogeography of the mountain and the species pool under study when assessing the sensitivity of species to future climate change in mountain regions."

Herein we investigate the distribution and conservation problems of a relict interaction in the Sierra Nevada mountains (southern Europe) between the butterfly Agriades zullichi-a rare and threatened butterfly-and its larval foodplant Androsace vitaliana subsp. nevadensis. We designed an intensive field survey to obtain a comprehensive presence dataset. This was used to calibrate species distribution models with absences taken at local and regional extents, analyze the potential distribution, evaluate the influence of environmental factors in different geographical contexts, and evaluate conservation threats for both organisms. We found 39 presence localities inhabited by the larval foodplant and the butterfly comprising 60.93 ha, with 82 % of the area concentrated in ten larger localities. The local and regional distribution models explained 68.7 and 85.0 % deviance, indicating a suitable area of 1,884.8 and 9,621.22 ha respectively. Topography and soil properties were the most important variables in the local model and temperature in the regional model. We observed several threats such as restricted extent of occurrence, lack of larval foodplant regeneration, the negative effect of the ski resort and a potential high sensitivity to climate change. Finally, we recommend some management measures in order to improve the conservation of key populations of both species, reinforcing A. vitaliana nevadensis populations and researching the importance of phenology in the persistence of this interaction under climate change."

For that purpose, it is necessary to depict the relationships established between ecosystems and society considering the delivery, use and governance of ecosystem services. One effective way of doing so involves collaboration between researchers, who scientifically study the system, and managers, who have specific experience and technical knowledge. With this aim, we held two workshops in 2011 in the National Parks of Doana and Sierra Nevada, Andalusia (Spain), with researchers and managers from the protected areas at different organizational levels: local, regional and national. Taking the participative mental model technique as an inspiration, we developed a tool that was used as a means to allow a holistic analysis of ecosystem services from an interdisciplinary and participative perspective. We found that participatory mental models, help integrating ecosystem services into EBM as it includes stakeholders' proposals and knowledge. For the implementation of ecosystem services for management, we discuss the necessity of navigating a process that requires considerable changes, not only in using new concepts such as ecosystem services, but also in the management structures that govern the services. This process would require closer interaction between citizens, researchers and managers, and the creation of new participation spaces that include ecosystem service beneficiaries located beyond protected areas."

However, little is known about soil thermal dynamics in periglacial environments of semiarid mid-latitude mountains, where seasonal frost is dominant. From September 2006 to August 2012 we have monitored soil temperatures at different depths (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm) in a solifluction landform located at 3005 m.a.s.l. in the summit area of the Sierra Nevada (South Spain). Mean annual temperatures in the first meter of the soil ranged from 3.6 to 3.9 degrees C while the mean annual air temperature at the nearby Veleta peak was 0.08 degrees C. Therefore, these data point out the inexistence of widespread permafrost conditions today in this massif. Seasonal frost controls the geomorphodynamics even in the highest lands. Climate conditions have shown a large interannual variability, as it is characteristic in a high mountainous Mediterranean environment. These variations are reflected in the patterns of soil thermal dynamics. The depth and duration of the frozen layer are strongly conditioned by the thickness of the snow cover. The date of the first significant snowfalls conditioned the beginning and rhythm of freezing of the soil. Wet years resulted in a thick snow cover which insulated the ground from external climate oscillations and favored a shallow frost layer (2008-2009,2009-2010 and 2010-2011). On the other hand, years with low precipitations promoted deeper freezing of the soil down to 60-70 cm extending until late May or early June (2006-2007,2007-2008 and 2011-2012). When snow melted a high increase of temperatures of 10-12 degrees C in few weeks was recorded at all depths. At this time of the year, periglacial activity is enhanced due to higher water availability and the existence of freeze-thaw cycles. These were recorded mostly in spring and autumn in the first 50 cm depth of the soil, ranging from 9.8 days (at 2 cm) to 3.7 days (at 50 cm). However, the inactivity of solifluction landforms suggests that the combination of present-day soil temperatures together with moisture conditions is not favorable to promote solifluction activity in the periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada. Future climate scenarios point to a temperature increase and precipitation decrease in the area, which would entail deeper but shorter frozen soil layers. These conditions would not be favorable for active periglacial slope processes in the Sierra Nevada. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The Sierra Nevada is one of the most studied mountain ranges in southern Europe regarding its environmental evolution. The purpose of the present paper is to integrate and summarize all the studies focused on the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental history in this massif since the Last Glaciation. Research has focused both on different sedimentary records and historical sources. A wide range of geomorphological, sedimentological and geochronological techniques have been used to characterize the glacial, periglacial, wetland and lacustrine records for palaeoenvironmental purposes. For the last nine centuries tens of descriptions, maps and sketches describe the landscape of the summit area of the Sierra Nevada, providing evidences of the historical environmental events. Based on a multi-proxy approach, five periods have been identified: Last Glaciation, deglaciation, Holocene, Little Ice Age and recent evolution. Recent studies have detected the maximum expansion of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada around 30-32 ka BP, predating the global temperature minimum. No data about the environmental evolution is available between 20-30 ka BP. Around 19-20 ka BP glaciers advanced significantly. The process of deglaciation was rapid and around 14-15 ka BP the massif was almost free of ice. The Late Glacial promoted the formation of small glaciers in the highest northern cirques and widespread active periglacial processes (i.e. rock glaciers). During the Holocene there has been an alternation of colder/warmer periods and changing moisture conditions. Periglacial processes have been generally widespread in the summit area, with an increasing or decreasing activity depending on climate conditions. Ephemeral reappearance of small glacial cirques occurred in the highest northern cirques during the coldest and wettest phases. This is the case of the Little Ice Age, as revealed by historical documents and sedimentary records. Since the last decades of the XIX century the temperature has increased similar to 0.93 degrees C leading to a decrease of the intensity of periglacial processes in the high lands of the Sierra Nevada.

The biodiversity and ecosystems protected by these areas deliver several ecosystem services. Recently, besides increasing global protected coverage, there has been a growing demand to assess the adequacy of protected areas management. In this study, we assessed how the management of protected areas can deal with ecosystem services taking as example the Don ana and Sierra Nevada protected areas (Spain). For that aim we analyzed the protected area management plans, mapped seven ecosystem services, and assessed how they are affected by protected area zoning and land-use intensity. We found that although provisioning and cultural services are included in the management plans of the protected areas under a different terminology, regulating services are barely addressed. Ecosystem service delivery varies depending on several factors including the protection category of the protected areas (protection intensity), land-use intensity and geomorphological factors, among others. Therefore, we discuss that integrating ecosystem services in protected area management requires dealing with complexity, necessitating the establishment of specific goals for ecosystem service delivery, which include ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs."

Most papers on the relationships between taxa and area adopt the species-level approach. By contrast, our approach exports these concepts to other organizational levels of biodiversity and analyses the community-area relationships in the Betic mountain ranges at 4 levels of syntaxonomical hierarchy. Our approach also aims at studying the diversity of communities in the same way as taxonomical diversity is studied. To evaluate the matching of data to the different models, we used the regression coefficient (R-2) and the corrected version of Akaike's information criterion (AICc). The highest altitude of a sierra was taken as a surrogate of habitat diversity. \"Syntaxonomical diversity\" was evaluated in a similar way to the taxonomical diversity of Clarke & Warwick. We have studied 94 associations (belonging to 42 alliances, 36 orders and 25 classes). The calculated indexes reveal higher regression coefficient between richness in syntaxa and the parameter under study (area and highest altitude) in a semi-log model than in a log-log model. Although the best correlation is obtained considering both variables, the patterns of richness exhibit a higher correspondence with altitude than with area. Results confirm very high regression coefficient between richness in syntaxa and in the quantity of the endemic flora present in each sierra. The higher the syntaxonomical level concerned, the higher the regression coefficient. The richness of the syntaxa exhibits patterns similar to those of the endemic flora: the most important sites are siliceous Sierra Nevada, Sierra de Las Nieves and Sierra de Gador. There are important implications for conservation biology. These results show that approaches based on species and those based on communities are compatible for the preservation of biodiversity."

The Sierra Nevada, which occupies around 2000 km(2), is the southernmost mountain range in continental Europe. It has a wide diversity of habitats due to its range of altitude, a variable landscape, geological substrata and soil, hydrological resources, climate, etc. It is therefore of great botanical interest within the Mediterranean Region. A total of 395 taxa are currently accepted in the area: 2 Anthocerophyta, 69 Marchantiophyta and 324 Bryophyta (excluding infraspecific taxa, there are 2 species of hornworts, 68 species of liverworts and 309 species of mosses). The total number of species represents 21.8% of the European, 24.2% of the Mediterranean and 35.3% of the Iberian bryoflora. In addition, a total of 35 taxa are considered to be doubtfully present in the area, and 34 are excluded from the final list. Among the accepted species, three are included in the category of Critically Endangered in the Spanish Red List of threatened bryophytes, one is Endangered, 19 are Vulnerable, and one is considered Extinct in the studied area. The main threats for bryophytes in the area are analyzed. The original material of Bryum perremotifolium Ther., from the Sierra Nevada, is lectotypified and reidentified as Bryum schleicheri."

Regarding altitude, the most influential variables on organisms are temperature and ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, the first decreasing and the second increasing with altitude. Both variables affect ectotherms' biology, as ectotherms depend on environmental temperature for thermoregulation, frequently being heliotherms. Here, we studied dorsal coloration in the lizard Psammodromus algirus (Linnaeus, 1758) along a wide altitudinal gradient (2200 m) in Sierra Nevada (south-east Spain). We hypothesize that the skin will be darker with altitude, i.e. in environments with lower temperatures and higher UV radiation intensity. Results show that individual dorsal colorations became darker at high altitude. We propose two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this result: (1) darker dorsal surface would favour faster warming at high altitudes, where temperature is lower, and (2) darker dorsal surface would protect against UV radiation, stronger at high altitudes. We found significant relationships between both temperature and UV radiation and population dorsal darkness, giving mixed support for the two explanations. Moreover, dorsal hue was positively correlated with substrate hue, suggesting that hue evolved to maximize crypsis. Our study therefore suggests that geographical variation in dorsal coloration in this lizard is adaptive, and darkness coloration might have evolved in response to adverse conditions (low temperature and high UV radiation) at high altitudes.

Several environmental stressors vary geographically and thus organisms inhabiting different sites face different oxidant environments. Nevertheless, there is scarce information about how oxidative damage and antioxidant defences vary geographically in animals. Here we study how oxidative stress varies from lowlands (300-700 m asl) to highlands (2200-2500 m asl) in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. To accomplish this, antioxidant enzymatic activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, DT-diaphorase) and lipid peroxidation were assayed in tissue samples from the lizards' tail. Lipid peroxidation was higher in individuals from lowlands than from highlands, indicating higher oxidative stress in lowland lizards. These results suggest that environmental conditions are less oxidant at high elevations with respect to low ones. Therefore, our study shows that oxidative stress varies geographically, which should have important consequences for our understanding of geographic variation in physiology and life-history of organisms.

First, a slope-instability inventory of the Sierra Nevada was produced to identify the most common instability types. Subsequently, the Newmark's sliding rigid-block methodology, implemented in a geographic information system, was used to obtain the distribution of Newmark displacements in the area considering a M (w) 6.6 earthquake on the Padul Fault. The Newmark displacements were then compared to the distribution of the inventoried slope instabilities to identify the areas where seismicity could reactivate old slope instabilities or generate new ones, and to identify the involved landslide typology. The most likely seismically induced slope instabilities in the Sierra Nevada are rock falls and rock slides. These types of instabilities could be triggered by Newmark displacements of 2 cm or less."

We utilized tools from complex network theory to assess the robustness to species extinction of two Spanish alpine pollination networks. A comparison with ten additional alpine and subalpine pollination (ASP) networks allowed us to give our assessment a broader scope and provide a general view of ASP network robustness. We found a broad range of robustness among ASP networks. The two Spanish pollination networks ranked intermediate to high in robustness. This could be due to two of their structural features, connectance (proportion of potential interactions actually observed) and asymmetry (normalized difference between pollinator and plant richness), which showed a positive relationship with network robustness. A finer-scale focus on the two Spanish networks did not reveal differences between endemic and nonendemic plants in their functional role within the network but indicated that they differed in their robustness to pollinator extinction. Contrasting patterns across networks suggested that endemic robustness depends on community particularities. To improve the utility of robustness assessment as a conservation tool, we should increase our understanding on (1) the order in which network species will get extinct, (2) how species rewire once they have lost their partners, and (3) how much species depend on their mutualistic interaction."

Facilitation is known as the positive effect of one species (benefactor) on associated neighbouring species (beneficiaries). Although the beneficial part of this interaction has received considerable research interest, there is a gap of knowledge on the bidirectional nature of these interactions; in particular, the physiological and fitness consequences for both beneficiaries and benefactors. 2. Alpine cushion plants are generally strong benefactors, increasing species richness and abundance on a global scale, and provide a suitable system to study the physiological effects of bidirectional interactions and its consequences for reproduction. Current knowledge suggests that species improve their fitness when associated to a benefactor cushion species, whereas cushions may receive predominantly negative feedbacks. 3. We measured physiological and reproductive traits of the cushion species Arenaria tetraquetra ssp. amabilis and three other forbs (Eryngium glaciale, Lotus corniculatus ssp. glacialis and Plantago nivalis) in the dry Sierra Nevada Mountains, southern Spain. All four species were studied either when growing alone or when the three forbs were associated with the cushion plant. 4. The three forb species improved their water status when associated with the cushion, and Lotus and Plantago significantly increased their seed set. In contrast, Arenaria showed poorer water status and reduced flower density and seed set with increasing cover of beneficiary species. There was a clear relationship between physiological and reproductive traits in Arenaria growing without beneficiaries but not in Arenaria with beneficiaries. Control cushions (without beneficiary species) showed increased seed set and seed mass with increasing photosynthetic and water use efficiencies, respectively, the latter being positively related to leaf nitrogen content. In contrast, cushions with a large cover of beneficiary species did not show such relations. The missing relationship between physiological and reproductive traits for these facilitating cushions indicates that reproductive output in heavily colonized cushions may not be directly related to the plant physiological status and the availability of resources. 5. Our results revealed the antagonistic behaviour underlying the interaction between beneficiary species and facilitating cushion plants, similar to parasitic interactions. They also provide indications for changes in cushions' resource allocation pattern in response to colonization by beneficiaries."

The central Betic Cordillera (southern Spain) is affected by moderately active tectonic structures and seismicity. Part of this seismic activity is produced by several NW-SE normal faults located in the E of the Granada Basin. Here, we apply Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) data to quantify the deformation produced by the Granada fault and the Padul fault zones and the surrounding area. The Granada NW-SE active normal fault zone, 17 km in length, crosses the city of Granada, a very sensitive area from a seismic hazard point of view due to the population of the Granada town. At the Padul fault, there is no geodetic evidence of contemporary motion. Considering the evidence of recent activity from geologic data, this fault may experience discontinuous motion with a different seismogenic character. Despite the InSAR uncertainties, InSAR results are consistent with the estimated geologic deformation rates lower than 1 mm/yr. Our results also confirm previous InSAR studies in the Otura area showing an estimated average annual velocity along the SAR line-of-sight of up to 10 mm/year anthropogenic subsidence.

Fourteen local tur groupings were united into three groups by the similarity of long-term number dynamics. A negative effect of winter, which deviated from the average long-term winter by the level of snowiness, on the tur population was detected. Snowy winters damage not only males (that frequently die in avalanches), but also affect the birth rate subsequently; the portion of females, in spite of the male death, decreases anyway two years after winter, as well as the portion of underyearlings. It was demonstrated that the snowy winter effect is manifested only when the animal density is rather high. The following tendency was detected for the tur population: the greater the density before the winter, the larger the decrease in the animal density after it (and this tendency weakens one year after the winter). Wolf predation has no negative effect on the tur population in the reserve. A maximal association between the tur density and wolf density was found at a tur density up to 50 individuals/1000 hectares. With a further increase in the victim density, the wolf density changes independently of the tur density. Turs in the reserve are not easily accessible to poachers due to habitat peculiarities, and therefore, the role of poaching in the dynamics of their numbers is not significant."

Field, petrographic and geochemical criteria reveal mixing between gabbroic and aplitic magmas, giving rise to a variety of hybrid compositions. The rocks contain spongy plagioclase, quartz ocelli and amphibole-biotite clots that are interpreted as early crystals destabilized by reaction with the hybrid melts. Spongy plagioclase and quartz ocelli were mechanically transferred from the felsic to the mafic magma, whereas amphibole-biotite clots are former pyroxene crystals from the mafic magma. Multivariate statistics (principal component analysis) have been used to examine variations in the mineral trace element compositions, which are best explained by the crystal transfer process. This study shows that crystal transfer represents a mixing mechanism that can overcome some of the physical limitations of interaction between rheologically contrasting magmas and explain deviations of the hybrid compositions from the theoretical mixed chemical composition. In particular, hybrid whole-rock compositions show non-linear correlations in inter-element variation diagrams for elements that are enriched or depleted in preferentially transferred crystals. This effect has been quantified by extending magma mixing modelling to include crystal transfer. The composite dykes studied could be regarded as scale models of the behaviour of larger-scale magmatic systems, so this investigation has important implications for interpreting the petrogenesis of igneous suites by magma mixing."

"Plant-pollinator interactions have traditionally been a hot topic in ecology and evolutionary biology due to both the ecological services it offers and its complexity as a system. Plants generally show a high diversity of floral visitors, making generalism a more common condition than expected. Furthermore floral visitor community seems to have spatio-temporal fluctuations in diversity and composition. Those variations respond to plant intrinsic and extrinsic factors and can affect to evolutionary and ecological aspects of plant populations. Here we assess the temporal variation in the floral visitor assemblage of the generalist plant Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We set up two experimental plots homogenizing for spatial and microenvironmental conditions to ascertain only the temporal variations in the floral visitors assemblage. During the flowering season we did daily censuses of the floral visitors, determining them to morpho-species level and clumped them in 16 functional groups based on morphological and behavioral characteristics. We found a high diversity for the whole assemblage in both experimental plots with high temporal fluctuations during the flowering season. Our results suggest an important species turnover with high fluctuations in relative abundance for some functional groups, which may turn into important ecological and evolutionary consequences."

To understand the mechanisms controlling the variations of fluvial water and sediment discharge for the Ebro drainage basin, Spain, we apply a hydrological model HydroTrend. Comparison of model results with a 47-year observational record (AD 19531999) suggests that the model adequately captures annual average water discharge (simulated 408 m(3) s(-1) versus observed 425 m3 s-1) and sediment load (simulated 03 Mt yr(-1) versus observed 0.28 +/- 0.04 Mt yr(-1)) for the Ebro basin. A long-term (4000-year) simulation, driven by paleoclimate and anthropogenic land cover change scenarios, indicates that water discharge is controlled by the changes in precipitation, which has a high annual variability but no long-term trend. Modeled suspended sediment load, however, has an increasing trend overtime, which is closely related to anthropogenic land cover variations with no significant correlation to climatic changes. The simulation suggests that 4000 years ago the annual sediment load to the ocean was 30.5 Mt yr(-1), which increased over time to 47.2 Mt yr(-1) (AD 1860-1960). In the second half of the 20th century, the emplacement of large dams resulted in a dramatic decrease in suspended sediment discharge, eventually reducing the flux to the ocean by more than 99% (mean value changes from 38.1 Mt yr(-1) to 03 Mt yr(-1)).

Originally formulated for endotherms, it is controversial whether Bergmann's Rule may be applicable to ectotherms, given that larger ectotherms show diminished capacity for heating up. We predict that Bergmann's Rule will be applicable to ectotherms when the benefits of a higher conservation of heat due to a larger body size overcompensate for decreased capacity to heating up. We test this hypothesis in the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which shows increased body size with elevation in Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). We measured heating and cooling rates of lizards from different elevations (from 300 to 2500m above sea level) under controlled conditions. We found no significant differences in the heating rate along an elevational gradient. However, the cooling rate diminished with elevation and body size: highland lizards, with larger masses, have a higher thermal inertia for cooling, which allows them to maintain heat for more time and keep a high body temperature despite the lower thermal availability. Consequently, the net gaining of heat increased with elevation and body size. This study highlights that the heat conservation mechanism for explaining Bergmann's Rule works and is applicable to ectotherms, depending on the thermal benefits and costs associated with larger body sizes."

Here, we test several hypotheses on the evolution of escape speed in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. We test that: (1) Longer limbs should improve speed sprint. (2) Heavier lizards should be impaired regarding their sprint speed ability, suggesting a trade-off between fat storage and escape capability. (3) Males should achieve faster speeds due to their higher exposure to predators. (4) Gravid females, with increased body mass, should perform lower speed than non-gravid females. And (5) there are inter-population differences in sprint speed across an elevational gradient. We measured lizards sprint speed in a lineal raceway in the laboratory, filming races in standardized conditions and then calculating their maximal speed. We found that hind limb length greatly determined maximal sprint speed, lizards with longer limbs being faster. In parallel, higher body masses reduced maximal speed, which points to a trade-off between fat storage and escaping capability. Sexual differences also arose, as males were faster than females, as a consequence of males having longer limbs. Regarding females, gravidity did not impair maximal sprint speed, suggesting adaptations which compensate for the increased body mass. Finally, we found no elevational trend in both limbs length and sprint speed. In any case, this study suggests that selection on escape capacity may cast morphological evolution, and affect other life-history traits, such as fat storage and reproduction."

The reasons for burning in chaparral are grouped into six ecologically-based categories, each relying on a known response to fire of the chaparral flora, community, or landscape. The densities of people in the region were high, and villages needed large quantities of chaparral-derived materials with specific qualities to make many cultural objects. Because the majority of chaparral-occurring species used as cultural resources by Native groups required frequent fire in order to exist in sufficient quantity, or to be useful, fires caused by lightning strikes were likely insufficient to meet needs. The authors posit that tribes employed intentional burning to expand the availability, abundance, and diversity of plant materials necessary for foods, medicines, and critical technologies and that they collected plants and animals from across a mosaic of periodically burned chaparral stands at different stages of ecological succession. Overall the evidence suggests that the burning of chaparral, as a major strategy for economic intensification and extensification, altered the natural fire regimes of the foothills by expanding the burn season, shortening the fire-return interval in specific areas, and enhancing the abundance and density of species that suited specific cultural objectives."

We present a multiwavelength study of the Be/X-ray binary system XTE J1946+274 with the main goal of better characterizing its behavior during X-ray quiescence. We also aim to shed light on the possible mechanisms which trigger the X-ray activity for this source. Methods. XTE J1946+274 was observed by Chandra-ACIS during quiescence in 2013 March 12. In addition, this source has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife, Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) since 2011 September, and from the TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2005 April. We have performed spectral and photometric temporal analyses in order to investigate the quiescent state and transient behavior of this binary system. Results. Our optical study revealed that a long mass ejection event from the Be star took place in 2006, lasting for about seven years, and another one is currently ongoing. We also found that a large Be circumstellar disk is present during quiescence, although major X-ray activity is not observed. We made an attempt to explain this by assuming the permanently presence of a tilted (sometimes warped) Be decretion disk. The 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum of the neutron star during quiescence was well fitted with either an absorbed black-body or an absorbed power-law models. The main parameters obtained for these models were kT = 1.43 +/- 0.17 and Gamma = 0.9 +/- 0.4 (with N-H similar to 2-7 x 10(22) cm(-2)). The 0.3-10 keV flux of the source was similar to 0.8-1 x 10(-12) erg(-1) cm(-2) s(-1). Pulsations were found with P-pulse = 15.757(1) s (epoch MJD 56 363.115) and an rms pulse fraction of 32.1(3)%. The observed X-ray luminosity during quiescent periods was close to that of expected in supersonic propeller regimen."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"1432-0746"	NA	"[Arabaci, M.

The qualitative and quantitative analysis is based on filtered topography, local relief, swath-profile analysis, anomalies on stream orientation, bulk erosion volume, hypsometry, and steepness index (k(sn)). All these parameters are intimately linked to river incision and development of drainage pattern, having been calculated to assess the role of folding and faulting on the evolution of the Sierra Nevada. Moreover, uplift rates in the core of the Sierra Nevada have been deduced from an extrapolation of the position of Late Tortonian to Pliocene coastline deposits. These data have been compared to apatite (U-Th)/He, fission-track and Be-10 cosmogenic data from SE Spain in order to evaluate the consistency among uplift, thermal histories and denudation rates. Our preferred tectonic scenario is one that favors fast exhumation of the western Sierra Nevada in a NW SE overall compressive setting produced by the convergence between the Nubia and Africa plates. Sub-perpendicular to this compression, a westward 4 mm/year extensional hanging-wall displacement promotes uplift and unroofing of the western part of Sierra Nevada. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the Mediterranean Basin, planting pines has been a widespread practice that has transformed and degraded natural habitats. Understanding the response of living organisms to these anthropogenic disturbances and their management is essential for the conservation of biodiversity. Reforestation in Spain until the end of the 20th century was conducted primarily with Pinus species at unnaturally high densities. We have analyzed the response of a reptile community to thinning management in pine plantations within the Sierra Nevada National Park (SE Spain). Surveyed plots covered a gradient of tree densities (according treatments) from unlogged plots, 50% logged trees, 66% logged trees, and surrounding areas of open landscape with sparse trees. Four replicates (plots) were considered per treatment, with 4 visits per plot. In each plot, we measured three reptile community metrics, species richness, abundance, and Pielou's evenness. We hypothesize that reptile metrics will increase with the reduction of pine density and canopy, and an increase of solar radiation. Our results showed a negligible response after a 50% thinning, but a significant response of the reptile community after a 66% reduction. This study demonstrates that intense logging in pine plantations restores reptile diversity in the Mediterranean Basin. This is intended to serve as a model for forest management to restore biodiversity in this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Methods: Using partial least square regressions (PLSR), we explored how temporal variation in climatic conditions, vegetation dynamics and sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) severity impacted body condition of 473 Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) harvested between 1995 and 2008 in the highly seasonal Alpine ecosystem of Sierra Nevada Natural Space (SNNS), southern Spain. Results: Bottom-up regulation was found to only occur in healthy ibexes; the condition of infected ibexes was independent of primary productivity and snow cover. No link between ibex abundance and ibex body condition could be established when only considering infected individuals. Conclusions: The pernicious effects of mange on Iberian ibexes overcome the benefits of favorable environmental conditions. Even though the increase in primary production exerts a positive effect on the body condition of healthy ibexes, the scabietic individuals do not derive any advantage from increased resource availability. Further applied research coupled with continuous sanitary surveillance are needed to address remaining knowledge gaps associated with the transmission dynamics and management of sarcoptic mange in free-living populations."

Here we analyze a regionally extensive population of mappable planar surfaces, which crown several major, tectonically active sierras of the inner southeastern Betic Cordillera, SE Spain. Based on a synthesis of long-term landscape evolution involving landform reconnaissance, DEM-based morphometric analysis, structural geology, sediment provenance analysis, and field stratigraphy, we conclude that the summit surfaces are a mosaic of discrete, post-orogenic erosion surfaces that each developed in relation to Mediterranean marine base levels at a time when the sierras formed a series of low-elevation islands. They are not, therefore, fragments of a once regionally continuous paleoplain. The summit surfaces were partly the result of shallow-angle detachment faulting during the middle Miocene in response to lithospheric slab detachment. Where evidence exists that the resulting low-relief topography was reworked by marine abrasion during the Tortonian sea-level rise, the terminal age of the surfaces is latest Miocene. Age-bracketing based on strati-graphic correlations among the many depocentres of the region and on published thermochronological data indicates that some erosion surfaces locally formed in less than 3 million years (similar to 8 Ma-5.7 Ma). They were subsequently uplifted to their current elevations (1.7 to > 2 km) by Pliocene to Quaternary neotectonics in at least two major pulses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

New CGPS data from the central and eastern Betic Cordillera and its foreland-obtained mainly from the Topo-Iberia project allowed us to precisely determine the rate of tectonic deformation. Most of the displacements of the central and eastern Betics are westward, with a variable southwestward component, in relation to the Eurasian stable plate. While in the Iberian foreland the displacements are extremely low, some deformation related to low compressional deformation occurs in the easternmost foreland basin and eastern Betic Cordillera. The displacement increases substantially southwards and westwards in relation to present-day extensional deformation. Major active discontinuities correspond to the NW-SE normal fault zones, which dip westwards; they are located in Almeria-Tabernas; Balanegra, and western Sierra de Gador; whereas the Padul fault zone located west of Sierra Nevada extends northwards to the Granada Basin. NW-SE extensional faults are also observed to the north, in the Baza Basin. Moreover, the activity of dextral faults along the Sorbas-Tabernas-Alpujarras-Guajares band, generally considered as a transfer fault zone, is evidenced by the displacement data. These results come to demonstrate the low activity or inactivity of the large northern E-W oriented folds of the central and eastern Internal Zone, such as the Sierra de Los Filabres antiform. They also point to the possible residual activity of the northern part of the NE-SW Sierra Nevada antiform, where the maximum relief of the Cordillera is found. Altogether, our data support a heterogeneous present-day westward extension that affects the upper crust of the Betic Cordillera and increases towards the thinned continental crust of the Alboran Sea and towards the west, which is compatible with roll-back subduction along the Gibraltar Arc.

Twelve point clouds of the Corral del Veleta rock glacier, in Spain, were produced with two different software packages (123D Catch and Agisoft Photoscan), using Low Dynamic Range images and High Dynamic Range compositions (HDR) for three different years (2011, 2012 and 2014). The accuracy of the resulting point clouds was assessed using benchmark models acquired every year with a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. Three parameters were used to estimate the accuracy of each point cloud: the RMSE, the Cloud-to-Cloud distance (C2C) and the Multiscale-Model-to-Model comparison (M3C2). The M3C2 mean error ranged from 0.084 m (standard deviation of 0.403 m) to 1.451 m (standard deviation of 1.625 m). Agisoft Photoscan overcome 123D Catch, producing more accurate and denser point clouds in 11 out 12 cases, being this work, the first available comparison between both software packages in the literature. No significant improvement was observed using HDR pre-processing. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the geometrical accuracy of 3D models obtained using LDR and HDR compositions are compared.

This upward migration of lowland species will surely result in contact with related species inhabiting high-mountain ecosystems. We propose that an overlooked consequence of this upland movement is the possibility for interspecific hybridization between narrowly endemic alpine plants and widely distributed lowland plants. Genetic swamping due to introgressive hybridization might even lead to the genetic extinction of the endemic species, without any apparent detrimental demographic effect. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has long been ignored in the ecological literature, probably because is widely assumed that the ecological effects of climate change are more detrimental than its genetic effects. We tested our idea by searching for human-induced hybridization in a worldwide hotspot biodiversity, the high-mountains of the Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). About 25 % of the endemic flora is already hybridizing in these mountains, mostly with widespread lowland congeners. Some species are even already threatened due to genetic swamping. It is thereby urgent including in future conservation agendas a protocol for detecting and monitoring positive and negative effects of genetic swamping mediated by climate change in high mountains and other sensitive ecosystems."

In this work, we analyse the capacity of three pine species, namely cluster (Pinus pinaster), black (Pinus nigra) and Scots (Pinus sylvestris) pine, naturally set along an altitudinal gradient (1350-2000 m a.s.l. in SE Spain), to produce an induced defence against defoliation by an expanding pest, the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). Pines were subjected to experimental defoliation, and the tree response was analysed by means of chemical analysis and bioassays with first-instar larvae of T. pityocampa. None of the pine species showed a notable change in chemistry after experimental defoliation, suggesting that chemical defences in pines represent constitutive rather than inducible defences. However, constitutive defences do not deter T. pityocampa, and larval survival did not vary depending of the previous damage suffered by trees. These results indicate that the three pine species analysed have a low capacity to respond after T. pityocampa attack, and thus a limited induced response against the herbivory caused by this specialist insect.

These ultramafic rocks preserve unique prograde structures related to the pre- and peak high-pressure event (1.6-1.9 GPa and 680-710 degrees C). The oldest subduction-related structures are preserved in Atg-serpentinites: a penetrative S-1 foliation and associated L-1 stretching lineation that formed in a non-coaxial regime with a top-to-the-W sense of shear. This planar-linear fabric is crosscut by olivine +/- Ti-clinohumite veins, formed during the prograde breakdown of brucite and pre-metamorphic clinopyroxene, which form a system of veins decimetres long. They record embrittlement processes due to the release of 6 vol.% of H2O associated with brucite dehydration. The growth of prograde olivine and/or tremolite porphyroblasts is syn- to post-kinematic in relation to the S-1 foliation. Further reactions at higher temperature related to the complete break-down of the Atg (i.e. Atg-out) are post-kinematic to S-1. Prograde Chl-harzburgite is crosscut by sets of conjugate zones associated with grain-size reduction of olivine grains. These grain-size reduction zones are interpreted as brittle structures generated by hydrofracturing due to overpressure fluids in a compressional setting at low-differential stresses. Structures related to the exhumation process are mainly preserved in the metasedimentary host rock, where an S-2/L-2 planar-linear fabric developed within a shear zone dominated by a non-coaxial regime with a top-to-the-W sense of movement in a transpressional regime. Peak metamorphic conditions deduced for the schists are similar in pressure (1.3-1.9 GPa) but lower in temperature (560-590 degrees C) compared to the ultramafic rocks in contact with them, suggesting a major shear zone at the base of the ultramafic massif during D-2 deformation in a right-handed transpressional regime.

Nevertheless, as both kinds of strategies consume resources, animals cannot maximize investment in both strategies simultaneously, which should lead to trade-offs between the two. Accordingly, we hypothesize that there is a trade-off between sprint capacity and immune response, which are among the most important antipredatory and antiparasitic strategies, respectively, of many animals. Consequently, we predict that animals eliciting an immune response should reduce their sprint capacity. We experimentally tested this prediction in the lizard Psammodromus algirus. A group of lizards was inoculated with the antigen LPS (lipopolysaccharide of the cell wall of Escherichia coli), which activates the immune system, whereas the other group (control) was inoculated with phosphate buffer, which has no physiological effect. Before and after the inoculations, we filmed sprint capacity of lizards, estimating the maximal sprint speed. Males were faster than females before the activation of their immune system. Nonetheless, males' sprint speed diminished after the inoculation of LPS, whereas females' did not. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a trade-off between sprint speed and immune response in males. Consequently, male lizards combating a pathogen may suffer either higher risk of predation, or reduced fitness if they avoid this risk by spending more time in shelter."

Sprint performance is maximal within a certain range of body temperatures in ectotherms, whose thermal upkeep relies on exogenous thermal sources. Ectotherms can respond to diverse thermal environments either by shifting their thermal preferences or maintaining them through different adaptive mechanisms. Here, we tested whether maximum sprint speed of a lizard that shows conservative thermal ecology along a 2200-meter elevational gradient differs with body temperature in lizards from different elevations. Lizards ran faster at optimum than at suboptimum body temperature. Notably, high-elevation lizards were not faster than mid- and low-elevation lizards at suboptimum body temperature, despite their low-quality thermal environment. This result suggests that both preferred body temperature and thermal dependence of speed performance are co-adapted along the elevational gradient. High-elevation lizards display a number of thermoregulatory strategies that allow them to achieve high optimum body temperatures in a low thermal-quality habitat and thus maximize speed performance. As for reproductive condition, we did not find any effect of it on sprint speed, or any significant interaction with elevation or body temperature. However, strikingly, gravid females were significantly slower than males and non-gravid females at suboptimum temperature, but performed similarly well at optimal temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a new method to recognize areas of endemism which combines the results yielded by NDM program, based on the optimality criterion, and those obtained using MARXAN software, designed to ensure the representation of species in the management of biodiversity. The method has been tested using the endemic and threatened vascular flora of the South of the Iberian Peninsula (Andalusia). Eleven areas of endemism have been identified in this territory; Sierra Nevada, Sierra Bermeja and Sierra Tejeda y Almijara stand out primarily. Although most of the areas dealt with in our study are already efficiently protected, the intermountain depression known as the Hoya de Baza, an arid area, and Sierra de Gador are exceptions. This new methodology provided a useful tool in the fine-tuning of the selection of areas of endemism. A more precise and flexible selection of scale-dependent endemicity areas was accomplished in this manner. The combination of both criteria (endemicity and threat) not only provides a reliable representation of areas of endemism, but also optimum efficiency in terms of endemicity and presence threatened of species. This approach offers a more objective and flexible strategy which can be implemented on different scales. A lot of alternatives can be generated, so the same conservation objective can be achieved by different combinations of solutions.

This study shows vegetation changes from steppe-like to more forested environments, very similar to the cyclic oscillations related to late Pleistocene glacial-interglacial climate changes. Artemisia was abundant during cold-arid periods, indicating that this species was already widespread in this area during the latest Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. A review of pollen records from Anatolia agrees with this study, suggesting that the spreading of this arid species occurred during a major climatic change: the beginning of the first glaciations and probably a change in seasonality towards summer aridity. Artemisia temporarily disappeared from the region during warm-wet periods and thus we suggest that glacial-interglacial-type oscillations already occurred in the area during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene.

The main pigments were carotenoids that indicate cyanobacteria (zeaxanthin, echinenone and myxoxanthophyll), diatoms and chrysophytes (fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin) and green algae (lutein). The changes in pigment abundance over time were mainly explained by the temperature. Zeaxanthin showed a marked decrease from the 19th century to the present and is attributed to picoplanktonic cyanobacteria in Rio Seco Lake. This decrease may result from climate-driven factors affecting herbivorous grazing pressure and water residence time. The increasing human activity around the lake likely generated a high input of carotenoid-poor pigmented organic matter and led to the dilution of chlorophylls and labile carotenoids observed over recent decades."

However, too much dead wood can also contribute to extreme fire behavior. This tension between dead wood as habitat and dead wood as fuel has raised questions about appropriate quantities in fire-dependent forested ecosystems. Three plots installed in mixed conifer forest of the central Sierra Nevada in 1929 illustrate how amounts and sizes of dead wood have changed through time as a result of logging and fire exclusion. Diameter of snags was measured and CWD was mapped in the old-growth condition, prior to logging. Snags were re-measured in 2007 or 2008, and CWD was re-mapped in 20112. Snag density increased from 15.2 ha(-1) in 1929 to 140.0 ha(-1) in 2007/2008. However, average snag size declined, with 72% and 22% of snags classified as medium or large in 1929 and 2007/2008, respectively. Mechanisms of tree mortality also appear to have changed with greater mortality in smaller size classes, possibly as a result of higher live tree density. CWD volume, mass, and cover did not differ significantly between 1929 and 2012, with increased tree mortality and lack of periodic consumption by fire apparently compensating for the loss of inputs of large wood due to past logging. However, number of logs increased from 28 ha-1 to 76 ha(-1) and average size declined substantially. Because larger-sized dead wood is preferred by many wildlife species, the current condition of more, smaller, and more decayed woody pieces may have a lower ratio of habitat value relative to potential fire hazard than it once did. Size, density, and stage of decomposition are therefore potentially better metrics for managing dead wood than mass and/or volume alone. To restore dead wood to conditions more like those found historically will require growing larger trees and reducing the inputs of dead wood from small and intermediate-sized trees. Fire, which preferentially consumes smaller and more rotten wood, would also help shift the balance to larger and less decayed pieces. Published by Elsevier B.V."

Despite the importance of information transparency, the use and flow of information in collaborative adaptive management has not been characterized in detail in the literature, and currently there exist opportunities to develop strategies for increasing the exchange of information, as well as to track information flow in such contexts. As digital information channels and networks have been increased over the last decade, powerful new information monitoring tools have also been evolved allowing for the complete characterization of information products through their production, transport, use, and monitoring. This study uses these tools to investigate the use of various science and management information products in a case study-the Sierra Nevada Adaptive Management Project-using a mixed method (citation analysis, web analytics, and content analysis) research approach borrowed from the information processing and management field. The results from our case study show that information technologies greatly facilitate the flow and use of digital information, leading to multiparty collaborations such as knowledge transfer and public participation in science research.

We evaluated the performance of planted seedlings of two oak species at two sites in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain): one located within the current altitudinal forest range (1,600-1,760 m), and one above the upper forest limit (1,970-2,120 m). The forest service planted 1,350 seedlings of the deciduous Pyrenean oak and the evergreen Holm oak in a postfire successional shrubland. After 2 years, seedlings were monitored for survival, and a subset of 110 Pyrenean oaks and 185 Holm oaks were harvested for analyses of biomass and foliar nutrient status, C-13, and O-18. Both species showed the highest survival and leaf N status above the upper forest limit, and survival increased with altitude within each plot. The deciduous oak benefited most from planting at higher altitude, and it also had greater biomass at the higher site. Correlations between foliar N, O-18, and C-13 across elevations indicate tighter stomatal control of water loss and greater water-use efficiency with increasing plant N status at higher altitude, which may represent a so-far overlooked positive feedback mechanism that could foster uphill range shifts in water-limited mountain regions. Given ongoing trends and future projections of increasing temperature and aridity throughout the Mediterranean region, tree-species selection for forest restoration should target forecasted climatic conditions rather than those prevailing in the past. This study highlights that ecosystem restoration provides an opportunity to assist species range shifts under rapidly changing climate."

In a previous study we hypothesised that overcoming acorn predation would require both large-scale solutions to reduce predation by large mammals - which we had effectively obtained through ecosystem management leading to greater habitat complexity - and small-scale protection to tackle predation by small mammals - which we had been unsuccessful to encounter. In this study we aimed to test this hypothesis under the same management areas but with a new acorn-scale protective device named seed shelter. We carried out an acorn predation experiment in Sierra Nevada (S Spain), in a burnt area with three replicates of each of two post-fire management treatments: non-intervention (NI), with high habitat complexity due to the abundance of lying burnt trees, and salvage logging (SL), with low habitat complexity due to the previous felling and piling of the tree trunks and chopping of the branches. In each replicate we sowed 50 acorns with seed shelter and 50 acorns without (N = 600 acorns). After 129 days, predation by rodents averaged 17% for control acorns, while the seed shelter reduced this to nil. Predation by boars (17.5% overall) was not affected by the seed shelter but was reduced to one-sixth in the NI treatment (5% vs 30% in SL), so we obtained the lowest overall predation rates in the combined NI + seed shelter treatment (5%). We thus corroborated our hypothesis that combining large-scale management with an acorn-scale protection can greatly increase the success of sowing. We expect these outcomes to increase the effectiveness of direct sowing and to raise the share of this practice in reforestation, especially for species that develop best with direct sowing such as oaks.

The Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) is a sexually dimorphic mountain ungulate endemic to the Iberian Peninsula commonly affected by sarcoptic mange, a chronic catabolic skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. Since 1992, sarcoptic mange affects the Iberian ibex population of the Sierra Nevada Natural Space (SNNS). This study aims at exploring whether mange severity, in terms of prevalence and its effects on body condition, is male-biased in Iberian ibex. Findings: One thousand and seventy-one adult Iberian ibexes (439 females and 632 males) were randomly shot-harvested in the SNNS from May 1995 to February 2008. Sarcoptic mange stage was classified as healthy, mildly infected or severely infected. Sex-biased prevalence of severe mange was evaluated by a Chi-square test whereas the interaction between mange severity and sex on body condition was assessed by additive models. Among scabietic individuals, the prevalence of severely affected males was 1.29 times higher than in females. On the other hand, both sexes were not able to take profit of a higher availability of seasonal food resources when sarcoptic, particularly in the severe stages. Conclusions: Sarcoptic mange severity is male-biased in Iberian ibex, though not mange effects on body condition. Behavioural, immunological and physiological characteristics of males may contribute to this partial sex-biased susceptibility to sarcoptic mange."

These rocks are present in the European area along the Italian and French Alps, in the North-East area of Portugal, in the Sierra Nevada Massif (Spain) and in Greece. In particular, crystalline rocks are also widespread in Calabria and a high percentage of these rocks is present in the Sila, Serre and Aspromonte Massifs. Fresh or weathered crystalline rocks, highly fractured, may be affected by deep-seated landslides due to the presence of tectonic structures, which may predispose and control the landslide mechanisms. The Serra di Buda landslide, near the town of Acri (Cosenza), can be included among the deep-seated landslides which affect weathered crystalline rocks. Starting from the geological model, the analysis of the geotechnical data (digital terrain model, borehole logs, piezometer levels, superficial and deep displacements, geomaterial characteristics, etc.) allows to detect the uncertainties inherent the elements that concur to define the geotechnical model. To reduce some of these uncertainties a calibration by means of numerical modelling is carried out, and the results obtained show the usefulness of this approach."

The quartz in the soil is inherited mainly from the parent rock. However, a study of the surface characteristics of the quartz grains and measurement of non-Si elements (Al3+, Ti4+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+), both near-edge and in the centre of grains, showed that the quartz is altered substantially in the progression parent rock < Entisol < Inceptisol < Alfisol, and in the A, AC and Bt horizons rather than in the C horizon. In all profiles and horizons the content of non-Si elements was greater in the near-edge zones than in the centre of the grain. This pedochemical process thus operates mainly at the surface of the grain and results in a variety of pits, fissures and other corrosion features (hole or corrosion gulf, opening of inter-granular surfaces, areal alteration, smoothing of edges of conchoidal fractures, and deepening of incisions of conchoidal fractures). Estimation of the W index, which assesses the intensity of the weathering process from the size and density of the etch pits, revealed that many of the quartz grains had alterations somewhat similar to the quartzes of tropical soils. This study casts doubt on the paradigm of quartz inalterability in soils of little to medium pedological change in temperate zones."

This was assessed, for the first time in bryophytes, differentiating the soluble (mainly vacuolar) and insoluble (cell wall-bound) UVACs (respectively, SUVACs and IUVACs), which may represent different mechanisms to cope with UV radiation. The bulk levels of SUVACs and IUVACs, and the concentrations of seven individual compounds (five SUVACs and two IUVACs) were analyzed, and several environmental variables of the sampling points were obtained: longitude, latitude, altitude, ozone column, and modelled UV levels. Diverse positive relationships of UVAC variables with UV radiation levels were identified in both the temporal and spatial scales. The soluble compound p-coumaroylmalic acid showed significantly higher concentrations in the years after the onset of stratospheric ozone degradation (around 1975) with respect to the previous years. The bulk level and the concentrations of three individual SUVACs were higher in the Spanish samples analyzed in the present study than in the northern European samples analyzed in a previous study in which IUVACs were not considered. The bulk level of IUVACs was the biological variable best spatially correlated with the UV exposure of the samples and with important factors determining it, such as altitude and latitude. Furthermore, the bulk level of IUVACs was the biological variable selected by a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to reconstruct the past levels of UV-B radiation. The reconstructed UV-B did not show a clear trend in the period 1913-2006, which was coincident with other climatic and biological UV reconstructions. Both SUVACs and IUVACs were significant loading factors differentiating summer and autumn samples in the Principal Components Analysis conducted using both UVACs and the environmental variables, but again the bulk level of IUVACs was the main loading factor differentiating the samples collected from the highest and most UV-exposed localities (Sierra Nevada). In general, these findings suggest that UVACs were stimulated by increased UV levels in time or space, and that IUVACs would be better UV protectants than SUVACs, probably due to their more efficient screening capacity. Overall, UVACs of J. exsertifolia subsp. cordifolia were good UV biomarkers, and their location in the soluble or cell wall-bound fractions determined their usefulness in the different aspects of UV biomonitoring, including the assessment of the UV-B increase associated to anthropogenic ozone degradation. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore we closed a cycle of ecosystem service provision and societal feedback by rethinking and reassembling the core elements of both models.

It is based on digital elevation model of differences (DEMoD) among high-resolution digital models (HRDEM) produced from light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Because these qualitative approaches based on HRDEMs can be affected by errors related to misalignment between different passes of the airborne sensor and errors in classifying points, a simplified strategy was undertaken for their semi-automatic correction and supervision for analyzing geomorphological changes. Besides, it became possible to detect, delineate, and classify a total of 47 natural landslides and 50 slope-cut failures over an area of 234 km(2) on the basis of the analysis of the LiDAR products (DEMs and DEMoD) and the orthophotography imagery inspection integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). Most of the displacements detected were probably generated during the winter of 2009-2010 when a new record of cumulative rainfall was reached. The displacement rate of these movements cannot be known with precision, but the minimum velocity that can be obtained is 0.3 m/year regarding the period between the two data acquisitions carried out in November 2008 and July 2010.

The fungus produced spores in single species cultures, using Sorghum vulgare or Trifolium pratense as bait plant. The spores are 69-96 x 65-92 gm in diameter, brownish creamy to light brown, often appearing with a grayish tint in the dissecting microscope. They have a pitted surface (pit sizes about 0.8-1.6 x 0.7-1.4 gm in diameter and 0.6-1.3 gm deep), and are similar in size to several other Acaulospora species with pitted spore surfaces, such as A. nivalis, A. paulinae and A. sieverdingii, but smaller than A. minuta, A. puncatata and A. scrobicttlata. The new species can be distinguished from all these fungi by the combination of surface ornamentation, spore color and spore size. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences obtained from the ITS and partial LSU of the ribosomal gene confirm the new species in a separate clade within the Acaulosporaceae, close to A. nivalis, A. paulinae and A. sieverdingii.

This paper shows a methodological approach that combines the use of (satellite) Earth observation with ontologies to monitor Natura 2000 habitats and assess their functioning. We have created an ontological system called Savia that can describe both the ecosystem functioning and the behaviour of abiotic factors in a Natura 2000 habitat. This system is able to automatically download images from MODIS products, create indicators and compute temporal trends for them. We have developed an ontology that takes into account the different concepts and relations about indicators and temporal trends, and the spatio-temporal components of the datasets. All the information generated from datasets and MODIS images, is stored into a knowledge base according to the ontology. Users can formulate complex questions using a SPARQL end-point. This system has been tested and validated in a case study that uses Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests as a target habitat in Sierra Nevada (Spain), a Natura 2000 site. We assess ecosystem functioning using NDVI. The selected abiotic factor is snow cover. Savia provides useful data regarding these two variables and reflects relationships between them.

Sierra Nevada National Park (South Spain), with altitudes higher than 3500 m a.s.l., is part of the Global Change in Mountain Regions network. Snow occurrence just 40 km from the seaside determines a wide range of biodiversity, a snowmelt fluvial regime, and the associated ecosystem services. This work presents the local trend analysis of weather variables at this area together with additional snow-related variables. For this, long term point and distributed observations from weather stations and remote sensing sources were studied and used as input and calibration datasets of a physically based snow model to derive long term series of mean and maximum daily fraction of snow covered area, annual number of days with snow, annual number of days with precipitation, mean and maximum mean daily snow water equivalent, and snowmelt and evaporation volumes. The joint analysis of weather and snow variables showed a decrease trend in the persistence and extent of the snow cover area. The precipitation regime, rather than the temperature trend, seems to be the most relevant driver on the snow regime forcing in Mediterranean areas. This poses a constraint for rigorous scenario analysis in these regions, since the precipitation pattern is poorly approximated by climatic models in these regions."

We sampled 136 chemically immobilized male ibexes. The single effect of mange influenced hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, leukocytes, band neutrophils, monocytes, cholesterol, urea, creatine, and aspartate aminotransferase. Both mange and the period of the year also affected values of mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, neutrophils, glucose, and serum proteins. Scabietic animals showed a marked reduction in body weight (21.4 kg on average), which was more pronounced in winter.

GIS-based calculations of snowmelt-accumulation models must deal with nonnegligible scale effects below cell size, which may result in unsatisfactory predictions depending on the study scale. Terrestrial photography, whose scales can be adapted to the study problem, is a cost-effective technique, capable of reproducing snow dynamics at subgrid scale. A series of high-frequency images were combined with a mass and energy model to reproduce snow evolution at cell scale (30 m x 30 m) by means of the assimilation of the snow cover fraction observation dataset obtained from terrestrial photography in the Sierra Nevada, southern Spain. The ensemble transform Kalman filter technique is employed. The results show the convenience of adopting a selective depletion curve parameterization depending on the succession of accumulation-melting cycles in the snow season in these highly variable environments. A reduction in the error for snow depth to 50% (from 463.87 to 261.21 mm and from 238.22 to 128.50 mm) is achieved if the appropriate curve is selected."

Acute phase proteins (APPs) could be an indicator of sarcoptic mange disease and severity in Iberian ibex. Serum samples from 131 healthy and sarcoptic mange-affected Iberian ibexes were collected from 2005 to 2012 in Sierra Nevada Natural Space in southern Spain. Serum alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) concentrations were quantified, and statistically significant differences according to sarcoptic mange disease and severity were assessed. Both AGP and SAA were significantly higher in the sarcoptic mange-affected ibexes than in the healthy ones as well as in the severely affected ibexes as compared to those with less than 50 % of the body surface affected. For the first time, changes in APP are reported in relation to sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex. It is also reported for the first time that the intensity of APP increase depends on the severity of sarcoptic mange, which could be related with the pathological secondary amyloidosis, leading to organ dysfunction in severely mange-affected animals. Species and population differences in the increase of APP in response to sarcoptic mange could indicate individual and population differences in the immune capability of each population to deal with mange, population prevalence and mortality being the last indicators of such sensitivity."

This study examines the topography structure relationships in an effort to evaluate the tectonic signatures in the landscape, paying special attention to recent tectonic activity. In the study, the main focus is on the tectonic controls of the NAFS on the geomorphic evolution of alluvial fans and fan catchments in the Erzincan pull-apart basin. The observations of the amount of tilting of the alluvial fans (3) and its relation with morphometric (Asymmetry Factor (AF), Hypsometric Integral (HI), Fractal analysis of drainage networks (D)) properties of the fan catchments provide valuable information about the tectonic evolution of the basin area. The results of the analyses showed that the alluvial fan and fan catchment morphology in the pull-apart basin are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activity of the NAFS. The fault system in the basin has controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin, and aggradation processes by causing channel migration, channel incision and tilting the alluvial fans.

Results obtained through laboratory or mesocosm studies and measurement of contaminant concentrations in areas experiencing declines have supported a role of contaminants in these declines. The current study examines the effects of contaminant exposure to amphibians in situ in areas actually experiencing declines. Early larval Pseudacris regilla were translocated among Lassen Volcanic, Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, California, USA and caged in wetlands in 2001 and 2002 until metamorphosis. Twenty contaminants were identified in tadpoles with an average of 1.3-5.9 (maximum = 10) contaminants per animal. Sequoia National Park, which had the greatest variety and concentrations of contaminants in 2001, also had tadpoles that experienced the greatest mortality, slowest developmental rates and lowest cholinesterase activities. Yosemite and Sequoia tadpoles and metamorphs had greater genotoxicity than those in Lassen during 2001, as determined by flow cytometry. In 2001 tadpoles at Yosemite had a significantly higher rate of malformations, characterized as hemimelia (shortened femurs), than those at the other two parks but no significant differences were observed in 2002. Fewer differences in contaminant types and concentrations existed among parks during 2002 compared to 2001. In 2002 Sequoia tadpoles had higher mortality and slower developmental rates but there was no difference among parks in cholinesterase activities. Although concentrations of most contaminants were below known lethal concentrations, simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals and other stressors may have resulted in lethal and sublethal effects."

Here, we determined the role of pre-fire stand structure, directional topography, and burning conditions on fire severity in a large fire (12,697 ha) in Central Spain that burned a Pinus pinaster forest on July 2005. Fire severity was estimated using RdNBR based on Landsat 5 TM images. Forest stand structure was reconstructed by systematically sampling the burned area (n = 236). Burning conditions were established using weather information and a map of fire progression, based on which fire rate of spread and propagation direction were calculated. Topographic features in the direction of the fire-front were derived from a digital elevation model. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis was employed to relate each group of variables or the entire set to RdNBR. Fire severity was best explained by burning conditions (cross-validation correlation [CVC] 0.56), followed by pre-fire stand structure (CVC 0.34), and directional topography (CVC 0.17). Combining the three sets of variables, CVC increased to 0.71. Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning upslope, with high fire rate of spread, with heterogeneous and dense stands of P. pinaster and Quercus pyrenaica in the understory, receiving high solar radiation, among other characteristics. Fire severity was the result of interactive relationships between burning conditions, pre-fire stand structure, and directional topography. Thus, determining factors controlling fire severity from static stand structure or topography, as is often done, may not be appropriate."

Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9.3 and 2.9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density can be used as a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 53 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and a return to year-round aridity in southwestern Europe.

While the benefits of preserving life are indisputable, tail loss implies a number of physiological, social, reproductive and even metabolic costs derived from tail regeneration and reduced motility. In addition, predation risk is increased in lizards with autotomized tails. Metabolic rates increase with body temperature, which in ectotherms depends on external heat sources. Ectotherm thermoregulation is costly in terms of time consumption and exposure to predators, this cost depending on habitat thermal quality. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effects of tail autotomy on field and selected body temperature of an accurately thermoregulating lizard Psammodromus algirus in different thermal environments along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. According to a physiological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to show higher body temperatures that allow them to regenerate lost tissues faster, at least when the thermal environment is not limiting (at mid and low elevations). By contrast, according to an ethological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to avoid exposure to predators by reducing thermoregulation time, thus showing lower temperatures than lizards with non-autotomized tails. However, we found that the tail state did not significantly affect lizard field or selected body temperatures. On the one hand, a warmer thermal optimum could imply greater exposure to predators during basking, making motility-impaired lizards with autotomized tails more vulnerable, which could explain why the physiological hypothesis of autotomy thermal effect does not apply. On the other hand, lower body temperatures could be physiologically costly for lizards, which, together with the other costs resulting from tail autotomy, could jeopardize lizard fitness. Therefore, both hypotheses were not supported."	"PT: J"	NA	""	" "	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	"0952-8369"	NA	"[Zamora-Camacho, F.

Spain), comparing censuses made at the same locations in the 1980s and during 2008-2012. Censuses were made in three representative ecosystems: 1) Pyrenean oak woodland, 2) high-mountain juniper scrubland, 3) high-mountain summits. In a global change context, avian-community dynamics are related mainly to changes in two of the following drivers: climate change and land-use change occurring over the past 30 years. Our results show a continuous turnover of the bird community, with an overall 27% change in species composition, in an ecological setting that has changed little, especially in the high-mountain scrubland and summit areas. We detected an increase in species diversity relative to the 1980s, mostly in the Pyrenean oak woodland. Moreover, our results also show a sharp decrease in bird density during the 30-year study period, chiefly affecting the dominant species of the 1980s in the Pyrenean oak forest and in the high-mountain scrubland. In the high-summit ecosystems, the decline of alpine species has paralleled the uphill expansion of some mediterranean ones. The outcome of these processes is a community in continuous flux, both in composition and abundance, where interannual variability is similar to interdecadal variability. We conclude that the bird communities of Sierra Nevada are showing strong spatial and temporal dynamics that are now accelerating, perhaps because of global warming."

Using PCA and Bayesian inference we found that the genetic diversity was structured in three or four clusters, respectively. Using a genome scan method we identified 13 outlier loci, which showed a signature of positive selection. Partial Mantel tests were performed between the Euclidean distance matrices of geographic and climatic variables, versus the pair-wise genetic distance of the AFLP dataset and AFLP-positive outliers dataset.

The rhizosphere bacterial community associated with wild thyme, Thymus zygis L., plants was analyzed using cultivation, the creation of a near-full length 16S rRNA gene clone library and 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. The bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (mostly Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Although each approach gave a different perspective of the bacterial community, all classes/subclasses detected in the clone library and the cultured bacteria could be found in the pyrosequencing datasets. However, an exception caused by inconclusive taxonomic identification as a consequence of the short read length of pyrotags together with the detection of singleton sequences which corresponded to bacterial strains cultivated from the same sample highlight limitations and considerations which should be taken into account when analysing and interpreting amplicon datasets. Amplicon pyrosequencing of replicate rhizosphere soil samples taken a year later permit the definition of the core microbiome associated with Thymus zygis plants. Abundant bacterial families and predicted functional profiles of the core microbiome suggest that themain drivers of the bacterial community in the Thymus zygis rhizosphere are related to the nutrients originating from the plant root and to their participation in biogeochemical cycles thereby creating an intricate relationship with this aromatic plant to allow for a feedback ecological benefit."
